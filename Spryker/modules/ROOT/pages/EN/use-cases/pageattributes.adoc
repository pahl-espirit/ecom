=== Maintenance of page attributes
In contrast to the sections, the content pages do not have an EasyEdit frame, and so neither the buttons provided with it.
Therefore, no direct editing options are available for content pages in the {cc}.
Because of that, the `*Actions*` menu contains the menu item `*Edit Page*`, which is only visible for <<rp_contentpage,content pages>>.
It opens the edit dialog of the page and allows the maintenance of page attributes and metadata.
The attributes are required both for creating the corresponding page in {sp} and for SEO configuration.
