=== Navigation maintenance
In addition to a <<sp_navigation,main navigation>>, a shop generally has numerous other navigations.
The integration realised with the _{modulname}_ module offers the possibility to maintain these navigations with {fs} and to add further menu items.
This requires the following steps to be carried out first.

[NOTE]
====
The steps described refer to the *enhancement* of an existing navigation.
If instead an existing navigation should be managed completely in {fs}, its menu items must be deleted in {sp}.

Alternatively, a new navigation can be maintained in {fs}.
For this, it must first be created in {sp}.
====

Replacement of the ContentNavigationWidget::
The <<sp_widgets, `{fs}PreviewContentNavigationWidget`>> contained in the delivery replaces the `ContentNavigationWidget` existing in {sp}.
In {sp}, therefore, a replacement must be done by deleting the `ContentNavigationWidget` and adding the `{fs}PreviewContentNavigationWidget` instead.

Addition of a further menu item::
In the preview, an additional menu item is required to display the navigation.
It serves as a placeholder and must be added within the twig template that represents the first level menu items:
+
[source,PHP]
.Addition of a further menu item
----
[..]
<ul class="menu {{ menuClass }} grid grid--center grid--no-wrap">
   {% for node in data.nodes %}
      [..]
   {% endfor %}
   
   {% if isFsPreview() %}
      <li class="fs-navigation-extension" 
         style="padding-left: 1rem; transform: translate(0,15% );">
      </li>
   {% endif %}
</ul>
[..]
----

Definition of the Preview ID::
In addition to the placeholder, a preview ID is required for the preview.
It must be defined in the twig template that controls the output of the individual menu items:
+
[source, PHP]
.Definition of the Preview ID
----
{% block attributes %}
   {% if isFsPreview() and data.node.previewId is defined and data.node.previewId is not empty %}
      data-preview-id="{{ data.node.previewId }}" style="min-height: unset;"
   {% endif %}
{% endblock %}
----

[NOTE]
====
After the changes have been made, it may be necessary to empty the cache for the twig templates and to rebuild the frontend.
====

After a successful completion of the described steps, the corresponding navigation in {cc} is extended by a button, which allows the addition of further menu items.
The addition of further menu items requires the right to edit and delete.
If a user does not have these rights, the button is hidden.

A click on the button opens an editing dialog, in which a structure folder has to be selected as target of the new menu item.
If the referenced structure folder contains further subfolders, these are automatically displayed as sub-items of the new menu item.

[NOTE]
====
Mixing menu items maintained in {fs} and those originating from {sp} is not possible.
For this reason, menu items created using the {cc} are only appended to the existing navigation.
====

The changes done to the navigation finally require a release.
Therefore, the workflow <<fs-nav-wf,_Release Navigation_>> can be executed via via a button that appears by hovering over the navigation.
This workflow only performs a release, but not a publication.
The publication of the adaptations only takes place in the context of a <<fs-deployment,full generation>>.

[NOTE]
====
The button to execute the workflow requires the release right.
If a user does not have this right, hovering over the navigation has no effect.
