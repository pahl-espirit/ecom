[[fs-modules]]
=== Installation of the modules
In order to provide the functions of the _{modulname}_ module, the modules _{caas}_ and _{ocm}_ are additionally required, which must also be installed on the {fs} server.
Furthermore, when using the supplied _{refproject}_, the _{bwfs}_ must also be installed.

[NOTE]
====
The delivery contains only the _{modulname}_ module.
The _{caas}_ and _{ocm}_ modules as well as the _{bwfs}_ module are available from https://help.e-spirit.com[Technical Support].
====

To install the modules, open `*{manager}*` and select `*menu:Server properties[Modules]*`.

The main panel displays a list of all modules installed on the {fs} server.
After clicking btn:[Install], select the following files one after the other and confirm your selection with btn:[Open]:

* `firstspirit-connect-spryker-<Versionnumber>.fsm`
* `caas-<Versionnumber>.fsm`
* `fs-tpp-api-<Versionnumber>.fsm`
* `basicworkflows.fsm` (only required when using the _{bwfs}_)
 
After successful installation, the folders `{modulname} for {sp} {os}`, `{caas}`, `{fs} ThirdPartyPreview`, and optionally the folder `{bwfs}` were added to the list.
Each of which must have `All rights`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The _{caas}_ module contains a service that is used to specify a default configuration.
The necessary steps are described in the _{caasdocen}_.

After each installation or update of a module, the {fs} server must be restarted.
