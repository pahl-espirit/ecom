[[fs-projectimport]]
=== Project import
A part of the delivery is the reference project _{refproject}_, which has to be installed on the {fs} server.
Open the import dialog in `*{manager}*` via `*menu:Project[Import]*` and select the file `referenceproject.tar.gz` from your local file system via the btn:[Local] button.
Then enter a project name and a description and confirm the import with btn:[Yes].
After the successful installation, the project was added to the list in the main panel.

[NOTE]
====
In addition to the standard groups `Everyone` and `Administrators`, there are three further *external* user groups in the reference project: `Editors`, `ChiefEditors` and `ProjectAdmins`.
The groups have different rights, which are selected according to their tasks and defined for the different stores.
Users outside these groups are not allowed to use the reference project by default.

The usage of external groups requires an LDAP connection.
Otherwise they are not usable and the rights set for them do not apply.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before actively using the project for editorial work, the Preview Deployment must be executed once.
For this, all configuration steps on both the {fs} and the {sp} side must be completed.
