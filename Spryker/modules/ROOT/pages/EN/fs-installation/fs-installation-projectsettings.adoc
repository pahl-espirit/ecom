[[fs-projectsettings]]
=== Project settings
There is some essential project-specific information that needs to be entered for the connection between {fs} and {sp}.
It is entered using the project settings form and must be specified within the project being used.

Within the supplied reference project, the {projectsettings_github}[project settings page] with the required configuration already exists.
In this case, there is no need to create the template or the required components.
Even defining the `settings page` in the `*Options*` of the project in the `*{manager}*` is no longer required.

The form of the project settings in the reference project is divided into the tabs `*General*` and `*Static Pages*`, in which different information must be entered:

Aktive Store::
This input component provides the option to select the store in which the created content is to be published.
The selection is read out at different points within the <<ref-project,{fs} templates>>.
+
Page Reference::
The feature associated with this field is not yet available in the current version.
It therefore has no function at this time.
+
////
The reference project contains a {tech_nav_github}[technical page reference] that is used to generate JSON for all <<rp_navigation,navigations>> maintained in the project.
It must be referenced using the input component to ensure that the JSON is transferred to the _Preview {c}_.

Static Page URLs::
This input component provides the option of assigning a relative URL to <<rp_staticsite,static pages>>.
This is needed because static pages do not have a URL by default and <<rp_links,content page links>> to them would therefore not be possible.
+
The definition of the URLs first requires a determination of all static pages.
For this purpose, the btn:[Static Page Templates Import] button within the reference project reads the contents of the {static_pages_github}[_static_pages_ template folder], 
which contains all page templates for static pages.
For each template, an entry is automatically created that contains a reference to the template and a language-dependent field for the relative URL to be defined.

[NOTE]
====
A future modification of the defined URLs requires the execution of both the <<fs-deployment,full generation>> and the <<fs-previewdeployment,preview generation>>.
