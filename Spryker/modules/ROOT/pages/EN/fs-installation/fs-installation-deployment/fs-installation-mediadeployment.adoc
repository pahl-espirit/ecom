[[fs-mediadeployment]]
=== Generation schedule - Media generation
Unlike the content created with {fs}, the released media is not transferred to the _{c}_, but to the CDN provided by the {creator}.
Therefore, the {refproject_github}[reference project] has the schedule _Media Deployment_, which is created within the `*{manager}*` in the `*menu:Project properties[Schedule management]*` area.
It is triggered by the <<fs-deployment-media,_Execute Publish Media to CDN_>> action contained in the full generation 
and has the actions <<fs-mediadeployment-generation,_Media Generation_>> and <<fs-mediadeployment-publish,_Publish to CDN_>>.
These are described in the following subchapters.

[NOTE]
====
If it is desired to use a local CDN or a MAM instead of the CDN provided by the {creator}, the {techsupport} will assist with the configuration.

[[fs-mediadeployment-generation]]
==== Media Generation
To transfer the media to the CDN provided by the {creator}, they must first be generated.
Therefore the schedule contains the generation action _Media Generation_.
It represents a partial generation, which refers to the root node of the Media Store.

To avoid inconsistencies in the live state, the options `Clear generation directory beforehand` and `Generate release version` must be activated in the `Properties` of the action.
Furthermore, it is necessary that the URL Factory selected at this point for `PathGeneration` and the 
https://docs.e-spirit.com/module/caas/CaaS_FSM_Documentation_DE.html#schedule_conf[`URL-Factory for media use`] configured in the project component of the _{c}_ are identical.

[[fs-mediadeployment-publish]]
==== Publish to CDN
Once the media have been generated, they are transferred to the CDN.
Therefore, the schedule contains the action _Publish to CDN_.
In the Cloud environment, this action is added by the Cloud department of the {creator} and is thus already preconfigured.
No further configuration is required.

[NOTE]
====
In the On Premises environment, a manual creation and configuration of this action is required.
The necessary information is provided by the {creator}.
