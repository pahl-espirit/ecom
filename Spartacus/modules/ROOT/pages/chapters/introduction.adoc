== Introduction
Customers' expectations of modern e-commerce shop systems are becoming increasingly diverse:
In addition to the pure display of product catalogs, they must provide customers with unique and personalized shopping experiences.
Thereby, customers want to be addressed via all channels and devices used by them.
The number of touchpoints used is therefore unlimited.

The _{modulname} (Headless) for SAP {ccloud}_ integration links the Digital Experience Platform {fs} with the e-commerce shop system SAP {ccloud} in combination with the {storefront}[{sp} Storefront].
It thus creates a powerful overall system that combines the functional advantages of these systems and enables the delivery of modern and personalized content.

Editors are provided full access to the SAP {ccloud} product catalog and can supplement it with editorial content such as shoppable videos.
The content is thereby maintained using an intuitive WYSIWYG interface provided by {fs}.
They also have the ability to create new content.
The content can be integrated in pages of various types - on the homepage as well as on landing pages or product and category pages.
For this, knowledge of the e-commerce shop system is not required.
The WYSIWYG interface provides all the necessary functionalities.

The content is still delivered by the {sp} Storefront.
However, the Storefront no longer obtains this content exclusively from SAP {ccloud}, but also from the _{fs} {c}_ (Content as a Service).
The _{c}_ is a central content repository and persists the content maintained in {fs}. +
The overall system of {fs}, {sp} and the SAP {ccloud} thus has an architecture in which the editorial backend of {fs} is clearly separated from the {sp} Storefront.

[NOTE]
====
If the expression "{ccloud}" is used in the remainder of this documentation, this refers to SAP {ccloud} in all cases. +
This also applies to the short form "{modulname}", which within this documentation always refers to the _{modulname} (Headless) for SAP {ccloud}_ integration.

Furthermore, the entire document is geared towards connecting to the {storefront}[{sp} Storefront] and the B2C demo shop.
Mention of the Storefront refers to the {sp} Storefront in all cases.
====

[NOTE]
====
Included in the delivery of the _{modulname} (Headless) for SAP {ccloud}_ module is the reference project _{refproject}_.
This documentation is consistently based on the reference project and provides an explanation of the functions made available by the module using common use cases.
====

// *********************** Funktionsumfang *********************** //
=== Range of functions
_{modulname}_ allows to:

// * Extension of the shop navigation
* Access product and category information
* Creation of new editorial content
* Display shop elements and editorial content in the {fs} preview simultaneously
* Delivery of content to any touchpoints

The corresponding functions are made available when the module is installed and configured within the WYSIWYG client.

Familiar {fs} tools are used to maintain the content, meaning that editors who are already familiar with {fs} do not require any additional knowledge - especially not about the e-commerce shop system.
The content is made available to the Storefront using the _{c}_ and is delivered by the Storefront in combination with the content from the {ccloud}.

This means that within the newly created overall system there is no difference for the delivery of editorial content.
It is still carried out by the Storefront.
Even if the {fs} server is maintained, this affects neither the Storefront nor the {ccloud}.

// *********************** Architektur *********************** //
=== Architecture
By default, the SAP shop architecture consists of the {ccloud} and the {storefront}/[{sp} Storefront].
While, in this system, the {ccloud} provides all shop functionalities and persists all shop content, the {sp} Storefront delivers this content.

With the _{modulname} (Headless) for SAP {ccloud}_ solution, {fs} and the {caasproden}[_{c}_] integrate into this architecture and extend the shop functionalities of the {ccloud}.
The integration thus creates an overall system that combines the functional strengths of the individual systems.
Within this overall system {fs} and the {ccloud} represent the backend, while the _{c}_ forms the middleware and the Storefront is the front end.

The following graphic shows the high-level architecture of this overall system:

Within the newly created overall system, the Storefront continues to deliver the content, which it by default obtains from the {ccloud}.
In addition, it queries the content of the respective _{c}_ instance and links it with those of the {ccloud}.
For this purpose it is extended by the `fs-spartacus-bridge` library.

In contrast to the delivery of the content, its creation and maintenance shifts from the {ccloud} to {fs}.
With the {wc}, {fs} provides an intuitive WYSIWYG client for this purpose.
The so-called {tppdocen}[_{ocm}_] (OCM) is integrated into this client, which allows displaying external content in the {wc} (see figure <<img_architecture2>>).

By embedding the Storefront in the {ocm}, the editors are provided with a combined preview of the content, which in this case originate from the _Preview {c}_ and the {ccloud}.
This way, the editors get the possibility to edit already existing shop pages in the {wc}.
For this purpose, a variety of different components, such as shoppable videos, are available for them.

Product and category information is provided via a report in the {wc}.
This report accesses the Product Catalog via the {ccloud}'s `CMS WebServices` interface and thus determines the necessary data.

The transfer of the created or modified content to the _Online {c}_ is done with each release.
The _{c}_ persists the content in JSON format in the form of content fragments and makes them available to the Storefront, which integrates them into the shop together with the {ccloud} content.
In order to display content originating from the reference project, the Storefront must include the `fs-spartacus-view-components` library in addition to the bridge.

The overall system of {fs}, {sp} and the {ccloud} thus has an architecture in which the editorial backend of {fs} is clearly separated from the Storefront.
A maintenance of {fs} affects neither the Storefront nor the {ccloud}.

// *********************** Concept *********************** //
=== Concept
The _{modulname}_ integration enables editorial content for the Storefront to be maintained in {fs} and this to be transferred into the _{c}_. 
From there it is retrieved from the Storefront and delivered together with the product information from the {ccloud}.
For this, the processing of content in both systems must be coordinated and be mutually compatible.
The sub-chapters below describe the underlying concept used to achieve this compatibility.


// *********************** Pages *********************** //
==== Pages
Similar to {fs}, the pages in {ccloud} are based on a structure of various components.
To enable editorial content to be exchanged between both systems, these components must be coordinated.

Within the reference project _{refproject}_ included in the delivery, the slots are represented by the content areas of a page template.
Sections can be added to them; each one corresponds to a component (see figure <<img_page_rendering>>).

{fs} can thus be used to generate components that are displayed in a page via slots.

// *********************** Page types *********************** //
[[concept_pagestypes]]
==== Page types
As described in the previous chapter, the maintenance of editorial content both in {fs} and in the {ccloud} is based on a page.
The integration differentiates between {sdp}s and the {fsdp}s.

{sdp}s::
In contrast to the {fsdp}s, the {sdp}s have a page both in {fs} and in the {ccloud}.
For example, they correspond to the homepage or the product and category pages.
The contents maintained in {fs} overwrite or extend the existing contents in the predefined slots of these pages.

{fsdp}s::
{fsdp}s exist exclusively in {fs} and do not have an associated page in the {ccloud}.
They are used to create content or campaign pages, which are not necessarily included in the standard scope of the store.
{fsdp}s can either use the layout of a {sdp} or their own layout, which is defined in the Storefront.

The storage of the contents is identical for both page types:
They are transferred to the _{c}_ and persisted in it.
At the time a page is queried, the Storefront checks whether a page exists for a given ID in both the _{c}_ and the {ccloud}.
If this is the case, it is a {sdp}.
Otherwise, if only the _{c}_ contains a page for the corresponding ID, it is a {fsdp}.
If neither system returns a page, the Storefront displays an error page.

// *********************** Preview *********************** //
==== Preview
The integration effected by the _{modulname}_ module only allows {fs} to generate and maintain editorial content and to publish it in the form of JSON documents.
The Storefront, however, continues to determine the framework of a page, whose slots integrate the generated components.

To present the preview of a page, {fs} therefore determines its current view in the {sp} Storefront.
This in turn retrieves the editorial content from the _Preview {c}_ and replaces the corresponding components.
{fs} then displays the result in the {wc} using the _{ocm}_.
