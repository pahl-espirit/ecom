=== Project settings
The installation on the {ccloud} side includes the integration of the <<sp_installation_libraries,library `fs-spartacus-bridge`>>.
In addition to various _{c}_ information, this library expects a definition of the {ccloud} templates, whose processing is to be enabled in the {wc}.

For each {sdp} specified in the bridge configuration, a page must exist within {fs} and within the {ccloud}.
The mapping between the {fs} page template and the {ccloud} template is done via the project settings form.

For each {ccloud} template, the project settings contain an input component in which the corresponding page template is referenced.
Furthermore, a content folder is selected for content, product, and category pages.
These folders define the destination where the pages created based on the page templates are stored.
The site store contains folders with the same names in which the corresponding page references are stored.

[NOTE]
====
All reference names of the input components contained in the project settings use the following scheme:

* `ps_template_<Name of the {ccloud} Template>` or
* `ps_folder_<{ccloud} Page Type>`

When extending the project settings, this schema must be adopted for the reference names of new input components.
