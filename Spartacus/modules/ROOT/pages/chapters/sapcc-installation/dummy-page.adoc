=== Creation of a dummy page
For the maintenance of editorial content, the integration distinguishes between <<concept_pagestypes,Shop and {fsdp}s>>.
{fsdp}s can either use their own layout defined in the Storefront or the layout of a {sdp}.

In the second case, a dummy page must exist in the {ccloud}, which is empty except for the desired layout.
This means that it has, for example, a general header and footer, but does not contain any other content.

A dummy page can be created using an ImpEx script.
The script shown in the following code block generates the dummy page for the {fsdp}s included in the reference project.
It is based on the `LandingPage2Template` and contains only a header and a footer.
The existence of the dummy page is mandatory for using the {fsdp}s.

Further information on how to create new pages in {sp} is included in the {sapblog}[SAP blog].
