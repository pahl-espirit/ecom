== Introduction
Customers' expectations of modern e-commerce shop systems are becoming increasingly diverse:
In addition to the pure display of product catalogs, they must provide customers with unique and personalized shopping experiences.
Thereby, customers want to be addressed via all channels and devices used by them.
The number of touchpoints used is therefore unlimited.

The _{modulname} (Headless) for SAP {ccloud}_ integration links the Digital Experience Platform {fs} with the e-commerce shop system SAP {ccloud} in combination
with the {storefront}[{sp} Storefront].
It thus creates a powerful overall system that combines the functional advantages of these systems and enables the delivery of modern and personalized content.

This document is intended for server administrators and therefore only describes the installation and configuration of the module as well as the import of the reference project on the {server}.
All steps to be performed in the project and the functionalities provided with the integration are described in the _{spartacusdocen}_.

[NOTE]
====
If the expression "{ccloud}" is used in the remainder of this documentation, this refers to SAP {ccloud} in all cases. +
This also applies to the short form "{modulname}", which within this documentation always refers to the _{modulname} (Headless) for SAP {ccloud}_ integration.

Furthermore, the entire document is geared towards connecting to the {storefront}[{sp} Storefront].
Mention of the Storefront refers to the {sp} Storefront in all cases.

// *********************** Funktionsumfang *********************** //
=== Range of functions
_{modulname}_ allows to:

// * Extension of the shop navigation
* Access to product and category information
* Creation of new editorial content
* Display shop elements and editorial content in the {fs} preview simultaneously
* Delivery of content to any touchpoints

The corresponding functions are made available when the module is installed and configured within the WYSIWYG client.

Familiar {fs} tools are used to maintain the content, meaning that editors who are already familiar with {fs} do not require any additional knowledge - especially not about the e-commerce shop system.
The content is made available to the Storefront using the {c} and is delivered by the Storefront in combination with the content from the {ccloud}.

This means that within the newly created overall system there is no difference for the delivery of editorial content.
It is still carried out by the storefront.
Even if the {fs} server is maintained, this affects neither the Storefront nor the {ccloud}.


// *********************** Architektur *********************** //
=== Architecture
By default, the SAP shop architecture consists of the {ccloud} and the {storefront}[{sp} Storefront].
While, in this system, the {ccloud} provides all shop functionalities and persists all shop contents, the {sp} Storefront delivers these contents.

With the _{modulname} (Headless) for SAP {ccloud}_ solution, {fs} and the {caasproden}[{c}] integrate into this architecture and extend the shop functionalities of the {ccloud}.
The integration thus creates an overall system that combines the functional strengths of the individual systems.
Within this overall system {fs} and the {ccloud} represent the backend, while the {c} forms the middleware and the storefront is the front end.

The following graphic shows the high-level architecture of this overall system:

Within the newly created overall system, the Storefront continues to deliver the content, which it by default obtains from the {ccloud}.
In addition, it queries the contents of the respective {c} instance and links them with those of the {ccloud}.
For this purpose it is extended by the `fs-spartacus-bridge` library.

In contrast to the delivery of the contents, their creation and maintenance shifts from the {ccloud} to {fs}.
With the {wc}, {fs} provides an intuitive WYSIWYG client for this purpose.
The so-called {tppdocen}[_{ocm}_] (OCM) is integrated into this client, which allows the preview and editing of external content in the {wc} (see figure <<img_architecture2>>).

By embedding the Staged Storefront in the {ocm}, the editors are provided with a combined preview of the contents, which in this case originate from the preview {c} and the {ccloud}.
This way, the editors get the possibility to edit already existing shop pages in the {wc}.
For this purpose, a variety of different components, such as shoppable videos, are available for them.

Product and category information is provided via a report in the {wc}.
This report accesses the Product Catalog via the {ccloud}'s `CMS WebServices` interface and thus determines the necessary data.

The transfer of the created or modified content to the online {c} is done with each release.
The {c} persists the content in JSON format in the form of content fragments and makes them available to the Storefront, which integrates them into the shop together with the {ccloud} contents.
In order to display content originating from the reference project, the Storefront must include the `fs-spartacus-view-components` library in addition to the bridge.

The overall system of {fs}, {sp} and the {ccloud} thus has an architecture in which the editorial backend of {fs} is clearly separated from the Storefront.
A maintenance of {fs} affects neither the Storefront nor the {ccloud}.
