=== Installation of the modules
In order to provide the functions of the _{modulname}_ module, the modules _{ccon}_ and _{ocm}_ are additionally required, which must also be installed on the {fs} server.
Furthermore, when using the supplied _{refproject}_, the _{bwfs}_, the _{cxt}_ and optionally _{ts}_ must also be installed.

[NOTE]
====
The delivery contains only the _{modulname}_ module.
The _{ccon}_ and _{ocm}_ modules as well as the _{bwfs}_, the _{cxt}_, and the _{ts}_ module are available from the {techsupport}.
====

To install the modules, open `*{manager}*` and select `*menu:Server properties[Modules]*`.

The main panel displays a list of all modules installed on the {fs} server.
After clicking btn:[Install], select the following files one after the other and confirm your selection with btn:[Open]:

* `contentconnect-sap-module-<Versionnumber>.fsm` 
* `caas-connect-<Versionnumber>.fsm`
* `fs-tpp-api-<Versionnumber>.fsm`

* `basicworkflows-fsm-<Versionnumber>.fsm` (only required when using the _{bwfs}_)

After the successful installation, the folders `{modulname} for SAP {ccloud}`, `{ccon}`, `{fs} ThirdPartyPreview` and optionally the folders `{bwfs}`, `{cxt}` and `{fs} {ts}` were added to the list.
Each of which must have `All rights`.

The necessary steps are described in the _{spartacusdocen}_ and _{ccondocen}_.
