=== Concept
The _{modulname}_ module offers the possibility to maintain editorial contents in {fs} and to transfer them afterwards via deployment to {sp}.
For this, content processing in both systems must be coordinated and compatible with each other.
The subchapters below describe the underlying concept used to archieve this compatibility.

==== Pages
Similar to {fs}, pages in {sp} are based on a structure of different components.
In order to exchange editorial content between the two systems, these components must be coordinated.

Within the {refproject_github}[reference project _{refproject}_] included in the delivery, the CMS slots from {sp} are represented by the content areas of a page template in {fs}.
Sections corresponding to a CMS block can be added to them.

With {fs}, CMS blocks can be generated that are displayed in a page via CMS slots.

==== Preview
The integration realized with the _{modulname}_ module only allows {fs} to generate and maintain editorial content and to publish it in the form of CMS blocks.
However, {sp} still determines the framework of a page whose CMS slots integrate the generated blocks.

To present the preview of a page, {fs} determines its current view in the storefront.
The storefront in turn queries the editorial content from the _Preview {c}_ and replaces the corresponding CMS blocks.
{fs} displays the result using the _{ocm}s_ in {cc}.

==== Deployment
The transmission of the content created in {fs} into the live state is done by {sp}.
For this, the content must be provided, which happens in form of the _Online {c}_.
From it {sp} imports the editorial content and persists it in its data system.
