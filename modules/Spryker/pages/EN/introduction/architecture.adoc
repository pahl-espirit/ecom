=== Architecture
The connection of {fs} and {sp} is realized by an architecture made up of a range of components (see figure <<architecture>>).

These components are:

* The modules installed on the {fs} server:
** _{modulname}_
** _{ocm}_
** _{caas}_
* {sp} Instance

The individual components always interact according to the following schema:

. In {fs}, the creation and editing of editorial content takes place in {cc}.
   With the help of the _{ocm}_, the storefront is embedded in it.
. The storefront in turn accesses the _Preview {c}_ and determines the current {fs} content from it.
   It also integrates the JavaScript required for _{ocm}_, which enables the content in {cc} to be edited and highlighted.
. The transfer of the editorial content into the _Preview {c}_ takes place automatically with each save action.
. The filling of the _Online {c}_ with the released content is triggered by a deployment.
   The _Online {c}_ makes the content available to the importer, who transfers it to {sp} and persists it there.

{sp} thus represents the main component of this architecture. 
In addition to providing all shop functionality, it imports the content created or maintained in {fs} from the _Online {c}_ and integrates it into the shop.
There is only a loose link between {fs} and {sp}.
They primarily work in parallel with one another.
