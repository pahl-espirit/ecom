=== Range of functions

_{modulname}_ enables editors to do the following:

* Creating native shop content with {fs}
* Access to product and category information
* Display shop elements and editorial content in the {fs} preview simultaneously
* Transfer of content into the {sp} {os}

The corresponding functions are made available when the module is installed and configured in {cc}.

Familiar {fs} tools are used to maintain the content, meaning that editors who are already familiar with {fs} do not require any additional knowledge.
The content is made available to {sp} as part of a deployment so that it can be imported.
{sp} then integrates the information into the shop.

Consequently there is no difference for {sp} in the delivering of editorial contents to the live state.
Even if the {fs} server is shut down due to maintenance work, for example, this does not affect {sp}.
