=== Important information
This chapter contains information that should be observed when using the _{modulname}_ module.

==== Configuration of the glue web server
During deployment, the content maintained in {fs} is retrieved from the _Online {c}_ using the importer.
It transfers the data to {sp} and persists them in the backend in its data system.

Since the _Online {c}_ potentially contains a large amount of data, the transfer of the contents requires a certain time span.
Therefore, early timeouts during the import should be avoided.
Due to this reason the web server of the glue API needs to be configured to allow http requests for a duration of at least 60 seconds.

==== Configuration of the {fs} project settings page
The _{c}_ generations assume that a template for the project settings is maintained in the {fs} project.
Otherwise, the generation job terminates early and reports the following error in the job logs:

[source,JAVA]
.Exception with missing project settings page
----
error during script execution : java.lang.IllegalStateException: 
Invalid value for key 'usedCaasProjects' - Value is not a HashMap (zero). 
This can happen when a deployment does not include a single PageRef (blue), which is not supported (e.g. remote-media-project).
----

For this reason, a template must exist in the project and be configured in the project options in `*{manager}*`, even if it has no content.

==== Use of the {sp} B2C Demo Shop
As mentioned before, the entire documentation is geared to the connection of the {sp} B2C Demo Shop.
When using it, some difficulties may occur that are neither caused by the _{modulname}_ module nor by the integration.
However, they are listed below and a possible solution is outlined.

[underline]#*Preview page not found in {cc}*#

If the {cc} cannot find the preview page, the page certificate is invalid or does not exist.
In this case, the page must be opened in a separate browser tab to renew the SSL certificate and allow the page to be displayed.
The preview page is then visible again in {cc}.

[underline]#*Missing RAM on Composer calls*#

There is a RAM limit for PHP by default, but it is too low to execute Composer actions.
For this reason, the limit defined in the `php.ini` configuration file in the `*etc/php/7.2/cli*` directory must be disabled:
