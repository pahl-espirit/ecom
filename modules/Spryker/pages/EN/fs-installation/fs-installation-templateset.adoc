[[fs-templateset]]
=== Template set
In addition to the existing template sets of a project, another XML channel is required.
This must be created manually for empty projects, but is already contained within the supplied {refproject_github}[reference project _{refproject}_].

The template set was created in the `*{manager}*` under `*menu:Project properties[Template sets]*` and has the following configuration:

.Template set
image::templateset.png[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
In the selection box of the same name, the <<fs-conversionrule,conversion rule>> created previously must be selected.
====

The template set is activated and therefore available in the project.
It is used to define the contents to be transmitted, which are summarized in messages during generation and transmitted to the _{c}_.
