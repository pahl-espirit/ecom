=== Configuration of the project component
A project-specific configuration is necessary for the use of the _{modulname}_ module.
This is done via the project component, which is already added to the supplied {refproject_github}[reference project].

[IMPORTANT]
====
To use the _{modulname}_ module, the _{caas}_ module must also be configured.
The necessary steps are described in the _{caasdocen}_.

For the media usage, the generation of media into the _{c}_ has been defined in the _{c}_ project component.
This configuration is explicitly *not* to be used in productive operation.
For productive operation, the media usage must be converted to the use of a CDN.
====

To configure the project component, open the `*{manager}*` and select `*menu:Project properties[Project components]*`.

The main panel displays a list of all existing project components.
Select `{modulname} for {fs} {os} Project Configuration` and open the corresponding configuration dialog via btn:[Configure].

The dialog is divided into the tabs `*General*`, `*Preview*`, `*Publication*`, and `*YouTube*`:

[underline]#*General*#

Within the tab `*General*`, the `Storefront Base URL` and the `Glue-API Base URL` have to be specified.
They have to be assigned to the {fs} server to connect to {sp} and retrieve data.

[underline]#*Preview*#

Within the `*Preview*` tab, the login path is required first.
The corresponding field contains the default value `/firstspirit_login_check`, which can be adjusted if necessary.

Furthermore, the login data of a technical user must be entered in this tab.
This must correspond to the <<sp_customer,Customer>> defined during the steps to be performed on the {sp} side.
In {sp}, it is used to query the storefront, which is included in the {cc} using the _{ocm}_.

[underline]#*Publication*#

The `*Publication*` tab contains a list of all groups and full deployment schedules available in the project.
It allows the selected deployment schedule to be provided in the `*Actions*` menu in the {cc}s for the groups selected in the tab.
The `*Actions*` menu contains the `*Publication*` menu item for executing the schedule.
For groups that are not allowed to execute the schedule, the entry is visible but disabled.

Within the supplied reference project, the ChiefEditors can be enabled to execute the <<fs-deployment,full deployment>> in this way, for example.

Furthermore, the <<fs-wf-adaptions,release>> and the <<fs-wf-adaptions,delete workflow>> use the selected schedule 
if the publication of the entire project should be triggered additionally to the release or deletion of a page.

[NOTE]
====
Server and project administrators are allowed to execute the full deployment by default, regardless of the configuration within the tab.

[underline]#*YouTube*#

The reference project provided contains a <<rp_section,Shoppable video paragraph>>.
It allows to display and reference products at defined times in a YouTube video.
The usage of the paragraph requires a https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started#before-you-start[`Google API Key`], which has to be entered here.

In addition, one or more `Channel Ids` can be specified, separated by commas.
As soon as the field contains an Id, the video selection will show a dropdown.
This allows to reference a YouTube video from a specific channel.
