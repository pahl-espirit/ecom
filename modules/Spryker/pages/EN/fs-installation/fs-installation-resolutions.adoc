=== Resolutions
The {refproject_github}[reference project _{refproject}_] has different sections, which can be used to include images on the various pages.
The editor should be able to cut the images to a certain detail.
This functionality is activated by specifying a resolution.

For the reference project the resolutions `CONTENT_IMAGE`, `BANNER_IMAGE` and `MAGAZINE_ARTICLE_BANNER` are required.
They are already created within the `*{manager}s*` in the `*menu:Project properties[Resolutions]*` area and specified at the corresponding places.
