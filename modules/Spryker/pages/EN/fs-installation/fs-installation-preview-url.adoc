[[fs_previewurl]]
=== Definition of the external preview URL
By using the _{ocm}_, the {cc} displays external content from {sp} to which the _{ocm}_ needs access.
The preview URL of the {sp} storefront must therefore be specified in the {cc} properties.
Since the specification is always project-specific, there is no default configuration for it within the reference project.

Open the `*menu:Project properties[{cc}]*` area within the `*{manager}*` and enter the URL of the storefront with the following syntax in the `External preview URL` field:

`https://[STOREFRONT_HOST_DOMAIN]/en/?firstSpiritPreview=[PREVIEW_INIT_TOKEN]`

The token to be specified for the `firstSpiritPreview` query parameter must match the <<sp_configuration,authentication token>> defined during the configuration on {sp} side.
It is stored in the https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/configuration-management[file `config_default-[environment\].php`] in the directory `*config/Shared*`.
