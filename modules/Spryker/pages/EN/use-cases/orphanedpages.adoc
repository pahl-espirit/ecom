=== Removal of orphaned product and category pages
In the course of a project, a {sp}-sided deletion or deactivation of no longer needed products or categories can occur at any time.
However, these are possibly still referenced within the {fs} project.
The deletion or deactivation results in orphaned <<rp_productpages,product>> and <<rp_categorypages,category pages>>, which can cause errors and warnings during the import.
These orphaned pages can no longer be accessed and therefore cannot be identified by editors. 

The {cc} therefore provides the report `*Lost and Found*`.
It shows an overview of all orphaned pages within the {fs} project and allows filtering for product or category pages.
Each entry has a delete button that appears when hovering over it and, after confirming a security question, triggers a <<fs-delete-wf-report,delete workflow>>.
The workflow removes the corresponding page from the {fs} project, releases the parent structure, and finally performs a <<fs-deployment,full deployment>>.

[NOTE]
====
The execution of the delete workflow requires both delete and release rights.
If the editor is missing one of these rights, the delete button is hidden for him and the removal of orphaned pages is therefore not possible.
