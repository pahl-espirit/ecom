=== Adding web components
Two web components are required for the `Preview` and for `{wc}` and have already been added to the reference project supplied.
Nevertheless, they still need to be installed on an active web server.
To do this, open the `*{manager}*` and select `*menu:Project properties[Web components]*`.

Inside the main panel, various tab pages are visible.
Each tab page contains a list of the existing web components.
The list contains the following entries both for the `Preview` as well the `{wc}` (see figure <<webcomponents>>):

* `{modulname} Web Component`
* `FS_JSTL_WebApp` 

Select a `Web server` on both tab pages via the selection box and start the installation by clicking the btn:[Install] button.
After successful installation, a dialog opens, in which the activation of the `Web server` must be confirmed.

More detailed information on how to add web components is available in the _{fsadmindoc_en}_.
