=== Workflows
Content is released, deleted, and published by editors within the supplied reference project _{projectname}_ via workflows.
For this reason, it contains a publish workflow, as well as the _{bwfs}_, which can be used as an alternative to project-specific workflows.

[underline]#*Installing the {bwfs} module*#

Before using the workflows, you must install the _{bwfs}_ module on the {fs} server and activate the web component.
The necessary steps are the same as for <<install,installing the other modules>> and <<wcomp,activating the associated web components>>.
However, the web component for the _{bwfs}_ is only needed on the `{wc}` tab page.

In addition, to use _{bwfs}_ in the {wc}, the provided `{bwfs} Status Provider` must be selected in the `*menu:Project properties[{wc}]*` area within the `*{manager}*`.
In the reference project _{projectname}_, this setting has already been applied (see figure <<statusprovider>>).

In addition, in the `*menu:Project properties[Options]*` area, the `Workflow for deleting elements` is preselected.
As a result, any action to delete elements within the project (Del button, delete icon) is executed via this workflow.
The native (independent of a workflow) deletion of elements is therefore not available - not even for the administrator.

[underline]#*Templates*#

The _{bwfs}_ and the workflow supplied with the _{sp}_ require different templates.
Usually, these need to be imported for the _{bwfs}_ via the context menu in the {fs} project used.
However, they are already available in the reference project and importing the templates is therefore not necessary.

[NOTE]
====
The publish workflow initiates the <<schedule,deployment schedule>> and requires its name for this.
If this deviates from the _Generate and deploy to SFCC_ expression, the value of the `scheduleName` variables must be adjusted accordingly within the script _SFCC Release Deployment_.
====

[underline]#*Permission assignment*#

In the final step, the workflows must be authorized in the individual stores so that they can be executed on {fs} elements.
To do this, select `*menu:Extras[Change permissions]*` from the context menu of the stores' root nodes to call up the permission assignment.
This step has also already been carried out in the reference project and is therefore omitted.

[NOTE]
====
The permissions for executing workflows set on the stores' root nodes relate to the `Everyone` group.
This can only be changed by modifying the permissions manually.
