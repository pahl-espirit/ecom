The main panel contains a list of all the modules installed on the {fs} server.
Click btn:[Install], then select the _contentconnect-fsm-<version number>.fsm_ file provided first, followed by the _WebDavDeployment-<version number>.fsm_ and _jstl.fsm_ files.
Each time you make a selection, click btn:[Open] to confirm it.
Once installation has been successfully completed, the folders `{modulname}`, `WebDavDeployment` and `JSTL` are added to the list.
Each of these must be given `All permissions`.

[NOTE]
====
The JSTL module only needs to be installed on the {fs} Server if JSTL has not yet been integrated on the server in any other way.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
After any module installation or update, the {fs} server needs to be restarted.
