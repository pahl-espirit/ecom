=== Project import
A part of the {sp} included in the delivery is the reference project _{projectname}_, which must be installed on the {fs} server.
To do this, open the import dialog in the `*{manager}*` via the menu item `*menu:Project[Import]*` and click the {local} button to select the `{modulname}ReferenceProject.tar.gz` file from your local data system.
Then assign a project name and description and confirm the import with btn:[Yes].
After successful installation, the project is added to the list in the main panel (see figure <<importedproject>>).

[IMPORTANT]
====
In addition to the standard groups `Everyone` and `Administrators`, there are four further user groups in the reference project: `Editors`, `ChiefEditors`, `Developers` and `ProjectAdmins`.
The groups have different rights, which are selected according to their tasks and defined for the different stores.
Users outside these groups are not allowed to use the reference project by default.
