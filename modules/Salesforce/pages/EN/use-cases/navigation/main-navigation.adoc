==== Main navigation
The main menu is primarily used to navigate between the various <<catlandingpage,category pages>> within the preview (see figure <<main_navigation>>).
The main menu is part of the HTML downloaded during the <<uc_preview,preview>> from the {ccloud} Storefront and is therefore predefined by {ccloud}.

[underline]#*Editor view*# +
The main menu allows the editor to switch between <<catlandingpage,category pages>>.
If an equivalent exists within {fs} for a category page that has been called up, then the content of this page is shown.
The editor is then able to edit the content originating from {fs}.
If no equivalent to the category page that has been called up exists within {fs}, the original content obtained from {ccloud} is issued instead.

[underline]#*Developer view*# +
To display a <<catlandingpage,category page>> that exists in {fs} to the editor, the links on the <<catlandingpage,category pages>> are redirected to a dispatcher page via a specific regular expression initially in the reference project.

This regular expression, along with other specific regular expressions, forms part of the _Preview Generation_ format template.

The _Preview Dispatcher_ referenced in this expression is a technical page based on the page template with the same name.
The _Preview Dispatcher_ iterates over the content of the structure folder _category_pages_ by using the {fs} navigation function.

[NOTE]
====
This structure folder corresponds to the folder that you configured as the target folder for creating new <<catlandingpage,category pages>> when <<pcomp,configuring the project component>>.
====

For each page found, the _Preview Dispatcher_ memorizes the associated category, together with a corresponding reference to the page.
As a result, for each call it can then decide whether a page exists in {fs} for the requested category and forward accordingly.

If it was not possible to identify any pages created in {fs} for a requested category, you are forwarded to a generic category preview page.
