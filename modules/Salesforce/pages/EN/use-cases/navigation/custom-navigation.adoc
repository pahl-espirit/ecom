==== Expanding the navigation function
Editors can expand the main navigation function.
New menu items are placed in front of those that already exist.

[underline]#*Editor view*# +
To add a navigation item, simply place a <<contentpage,content page>> below the `Left Navigation` menu item.
Once the page has been released and transferred to the {ccloud}, the new navigation item will appear in the storefront.
As shown in the <<custom_navigation>> figure, it is also possible to create nested menu structures.

Menu structures may be nested up to a maximum of 4 levels deep.

[underline]#*Developer view*# +
The new `menu-custom-left` global slot has been introduced on the {sf} side using the `menu.isml` template supplied, and is surrounded by the following comments:
`<!-- CMS-CUSTOM-NAVIGATION-LEFT-START -->` and `<!-- CMS-CUSTOM-NAVIGATION-LEFT-END -->`.
This slot can be populated by {fs} in the same way as any other slot and substituted in the preview.
A content asset for this slot contains the HTML for all elements that are to be used for expanding the navigation function.

This markup is created in {fs} in the `custom_navigation` format template.
This template contains a navigation function that searches all page references in the `Left Navigation` folder.
It then generates the required HTML for all the pages found - both for the preview and for the live state.
This is necessary so that the pages can be integrated into the main navigation function.
For the preview, the result is also enclosed within the following HTML comments: `<!-- CMS-CUSTOM-NAVIGATION-LEFT-START -->` and `<!-- CMS-CUSTOM-NAVIGATION-LEFT-END -->`.
The template outputs the HTML for the navigation function in both cases.

To enable this navigation function to be used in the preview, each page template must integrate the `custom_navigation` format template by calling up the `CMS_RENDER` function.

The `Left Navigation` page template, plus a page and a page reference based on this template, are provided for the purpose of generating a content asset.
The page reference is stored in the `Left Navigation` structure folder.
As described above, the page template integrates the `custom_navigation` format template and saves the generated content in a content asset via the XML collector.

Unlike the other page templates, `Left Navigation` does not provide any sections.
A <<slot_configuration,slot configuration>> that will be output in the event of a generation must therefore be maintained in its form.
For this purpose, the page template sets two variables prior to output.
The first of these is a `contentSlotId`, since there is no content area from that a slot ID could be derived.
The value of these variable is `menu-custom-left`, since the new slot referred to above is to be populated.
The second variable is `contentSlotTemplate`, which is set to the value of the `pt_sfccTemplate` form field.
The fallback value of this field is `slots/content/contentAssetBody.isml`.
Without this variable, the template for <<slot_configuration,slot configurations>> would attempt to derive the ISML template from the current section.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `Left Navigation` page reference as well as the corresponding page must be manually released once.
