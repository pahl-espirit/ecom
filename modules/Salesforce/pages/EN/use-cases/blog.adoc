=== Blog
In contrast to the <<hp,homepage>> and <<detail_pages,category and product pages>>, <<contentpage,content pages>> have the option to display blog articles.
Every blog article corresponds to a dataset of the _Article_ data source and must first be generated by the editor.

With the aid of two table templates, they can be presented either in the form of an overview of all available blog articles or as a detail view of one single article.
Both options are described in the sub-chapters below.

==== Article overview
The article overview presents all blog articles included in the project sorted by their creation date.
In each case, the display is limited to the heading of an article plus the teaser and teaser image.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The teaser image must be created with the resolution of `ARTICLE_TEASER_IMAGE`.
====

[underline]#*Editor view*# +
As the overview is generated automatically, the editor can only define the number of blog articles to be displayed as well as their distribution across one or more pages.
It is configured using the familiar {fs} functionality on the `Data` tab of the relevant page reference.

Apart from this, the editor has no access to the function other than to integrate the table template.

[underline]#*Developer view*# +
The HTML channel of the table template determines the datasets of the _Article_ data source and in each case outputs the heading, the teaser, and the teaser image of all blog articles one after the other.
The individual articles are separated by a horizontal line and their headings match the link to the relevant detail page.

[NOTE]
====
To link the detail page, its reference name must be known to the overview page.
In the reference project, the reference name of the relevant page reference (_magazine_article_) was therefore permanently included to the template for the overview page.
In individual scenarios, this is therefore to be adapted accordingly.
====

In addition, a navigation function is inserted in the first position before the list of blog articles.
This enables users to browse through the blog articles if they are distributed across several pages.
If all blog articles are presented on a single page, the navigation function is hidden.

[[blog_article]]
==== Articles
Every blog article corresponds to a dataset of the _Article_ data source and makes various input options available to the editor.

[underline]#*Editor view*# +
To create a blog article, the editor must first enter a heading and teaser text as well as select a teaser image.
A creation date and an author must also be specified.
The editor also has the option of specifying a banner or slider for the article.
These paragraphs are created as described in chapter <<banner,Banner>>.


To record the editorial content, the following sections are also available to the editor.
The _Article Tiles_ section can only be used within blog articles.
It is not included in the section selection for the page templates.

* *Shop the look* +
The section enables products to be presented as what are known as hot spots.
It corresponds to the section of the same name, which can be added to the <<hp,homepage>> and <<contentpage,content pages>> and which has already been described in the previous <<hot_spots,chapter>>.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the section is used within a <<blog_article,blog article>>, the image to be selected cannot be cropped.
This functionality is only available if the section is directly integrated into a page.
====

* *Article Tiles* +
This section can be used to present three blog articles side by side in a column view.
In each case, the view comprises the heading, the teaser image, and the teaser text plus the author and the creation date of the article.
Clicking the heading calls up the detail page of the corresponding blog article.
+
A heading can be specified for the section and displayed left-aligned, right-aligned, or centered above the blog articles.

[NOTE]
====
To link the detail page, the reference name of the relevant page reference (_magazine_article_) was permanently included to the template for the section.
In individual scenarios, this must be adapted accordingly.
====

* *Product Tiles* +
This section is available for blog articles and <<proddetailpage,product detail pages>>.
It is described in the <<producttiles,chapter of the same name>>.
In the same way as _Article Tiles_, this section presents three products side by side in a column view.
+

[[text_picture_section]]
* *Text Picture* +
The section provides five ways of adding text and/or images.
It corresponds to the section of the same name, which can be added to <<login_page,login pages>> and blog articles and is described in the <<textpicture,corresponding chapter>>.

[underline]#*Developer view*# +
The HTML channel first outputs the heading of the blog article along with the name of the author and the creation date.
It then determines the sections generated by the editor and displays these one after the other.

As there is no substitution of {sf} content, the blog content does not have to be labeled with HTML tags.
