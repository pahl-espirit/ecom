=== Release, deleting, and deployment
Content is released, deleted, and deployed within the supplied reference project _{projectname}_ via workflows.
For this reason, it contains a publish workflow, as well as the _{bwfs}_.

[underline]#*Editor view*# +
The _{bwfs}_ provide an editor with the option to release modified content and to remove {fs} elements both from the Current State and the Release State.
Both workflows are based on the four-eyes principle and are always executed in the context of a page.
If a conflict arises while a workflow is running, the workflow can be continued once the conflict has been rectified.

The publish workflow is available to editors to synchronize changes made in the {fs} project on the {sf} side.
It initiates the <<schedule,deployment schedule>> and is therefore executed without any context.
For this reason, it is started in {wc} via the `*Actions*` menu and in {jc} via the `*Task list*`.
The deployment schedule transfers all released content to {ccloud} and triggers the deletion of assets and <<slot_configuration,slot configurations>>, which have been removed in {fs}, on the {sf} side.

[underline]#*Developer view*# +
The release workflow and the delete workflow correspond to those of the _{bwfs}_ module and have not been changed.
The release workflow is oriented towards the administrative direct release and provides its functionality for the editor.
The delete workflow makes it possible to remove elements from the Current State and the Release State.

To transfer the changes made in the {fs} project, the publish workflow has also been added to the reference project.
Using the _SFCC Release Deployment_ script, this determines the <<schedule,deployment schedule>> and executes it.
Unlike the other two workflows, it does not refer explicitly to one single page.
For this reason, the option `Workflow executable without context` is activated in its `*Properties*`.

[NOTE]
====
To also remove the assets and <<slot_configuration,slot configurations>> deleted in the {fs} project on the {sf} side, the publish workflow must be executed.
