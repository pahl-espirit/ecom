[[detail_pages]]
=== Category and product pages
The _{modulname}_ module provides an individual report for products and categories in both {jc} and {wc}.
These reports are used to display the category and product information originating from {ccloud}, which can be used to create and maintain editorial content (see figure <<reports>>).

[NOTE]
====
To display the category report, the <<show_report,`Show Category Report`>> checkbox must be activated in the project component.
====

[[reports]]
.Reports

The corresponding report can be used to create both category pages as well as product pages.
To use this feature, you must define the templates on which these pages will be based, and where they are to be integrated into the structure, in the <<pcomp,project component>>.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `SFCC Context ID` field must be included in the page template that is selected in each case so that the ID of the referenced object can be saved.
The field can be hidden.
If this field ought to have a differing identifier for project-specific reasons, then this must be specified within the <<project_settings,project settings>>.

With regard to its category or product page, an object in the report can adopt one of three states:

. A category or product page does not exist and therefore can be created.
. A category or product page exists, which can be called up.
. A category or product page exists but either its page reference or the page cannot be found.

The three cases are displayed in different ways and described below.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Since the objects in the report are not permanently updated, the display might not reflect the current status.

Objects for that a category or product page does not yet exist are identified in the report by a gray icon (see figure <<report_create_normal>>).
If a page template has been defined in the <<pcomp,project component>>, the image:new_detailpage.png[Create Page] button is displayed when such an object is hovered over.

[TIP]
====
A button is also displayed in the <<uc_preview,{fs} preview>> on <<catlandingpage,category landing pages>>, <<catdetailpage,category detail pages>>, and <<proddetailpage,product detail pages>> that can be accessed via the navigation.
This button functions in the same way as the button in the report.
It is only visible if a corresponding category landing page, category detail page, or product detail page does not exist in the {fs} project.

====

Click on the button in the report or the button on a main category page to open a dialog that is split into two sections and in which a page can be created for the corresponding object.

The top section of the dialog is the `structure selection area`; it is completed automatically and as such is always the same.
Within the structure, the editor has the option to select the menu level at which to generate the new page.
The corresponding input component may already have been preassigned.
In this case, a <<default_folder,structure folder>> will already have been defined in the configuration dialog of the project component.
However, the editor is free to change this selection.

[NOTE]
====
In some cases, the `structure selection area` may be hidden in the dialog.
In this case, a <<default_folder,structure folder>> will also have been predefined in the project component.
At the same time, however, a setting will have been made to prevent the editor from changing this preassignment.
====

Unlike the `structure selection area`, the `form area` underneath is always project-specific.
It shows the form for the page template specified in the project component.
The rules defined in the template also apply here.

[[detail_pages_dialog_not_shown_note]]
[NOTE]
====
Within the reference project, the form fields of the category or product pages are automatically populated or have corresponding default values.
In addition, a structure folder is predefined in the <<pcomp,project component>>, which cannot be changed by the editor.
Both for the structure selection area and the form area, there is therefore no need for the editor to input anything.
The dialog is not shown for this reason.
====

An example dialog is shown in the figure below:

[[report_dialog_newpage]]
.Dialog for creating a category or product page
image::report_dialog_newpage.png[]

Click on btn:[Create] to generate the page reference for the category or product page at the selected menu level.
The corresponding page is created in a specific folder in the Page Store.
Within this folder, a distinction between category and product pages is made once again on the basis of subfolders.
The names of the page references and pages generated are based on the `product ID (product name)` or `category ID (category name) schema`.

If a script has also been specified in the <<pcomp,project component>>, it is usually executed before and after the category or product page is created.
The _create_sfcc_item_wizard_ script included in the reference project supplied does, however, have a corresponding query, which is used to initiate the script, but only once the page has been created.
It marks each created category or product page as translated for all languages and saves its storefront ID in the form.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Please note that only the code from the HTML channel of the script is executed.
====

The following parameters are transferred to this script:

[options="header", cols="25,25,80" ]
|=======
|Data type | Object name | Description
|BaseContext | context | The context in which the script is executed.
|boolean | beforeInstantiation | `true` if the script is executed before the page is created; otherwise `false`.
|KeyProvider | keyProvider | The object for that a category or product page is being created. This is either a `product` or a `category`.
|=======

[TIP]
====
The Javadoc documentation supplied describes the `KeyProvider`, `Product`, and `Category` interfaces.
====

Once the process to generate the category or product page and the execution of the script have been completed, the new page is called up automatically.


// ************************************ Seitenaufruf ************************************
[underline]#*Calling up an existing category or product page*# +
Objects for that a category or product page already exists are identified in the report by a green icon (see figure <<report_jump_to>>).
When you hover over them, the image:report_jump_icon.png[] button is displayed.
Click this button to call up the corresponding category or product page.

// ************************************ Defekte Referenzen ************************************
[underline]#*Broken reference to a category or product page*# +
If there are objects with a category or product page but the page reference or underlying page cannot be found, the objects are identified in the report by a red icon (see figure <<report_ref_broken>>).
When you hover over them, the image:report_broken_icon.png[Broken Reference] button is displayed.
Click on this button to open a dialog containing more information.

[[report_ref_broken]]
.Broken object

// ************************************ Versteckte Kategorien ************************************
[[hidden_categories]]
[underline]#*Hidden categories*# +
When the category report is called up, both visible as well as hidden categories are displayed by default.
By removing the `Include hidden categories` check mark, the results list can be limited to include only visible categories:

.Hiding hidden categories

[NOTE]
====
The identification of existing, broken, and unavailable references to category pages described in this chapter applies also to hidden categories.
