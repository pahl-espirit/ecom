=== Product Tiles
Like article tiles, which can only be used in <<blog_article,blog articles>>, this section presents three products side by side in a column view.
It is only permitted in a blog article or on a product detail page and shows the name, image, and a description for each product.
Clicking the product name opens the corresponding <<proddetailpage,product detail page>>.

[underline]#*Editor view*# +
In addition to the three products to be selected, the editor can specify an optional title made up of a maximum of 50 characters to be positioned on the left, on the right, or in the center above the product tiles.
The products can be referenced in the form using drag-and-drop (the product name is added as link text).
Unlike the product information, the product name can be edited.

[NOTE]
====
If the selection created by the editor contains fewer than three products, the page cannot be released.
It is not possible to select more than three products.

[underline]#*Developer view*# +
The products selected by the editor are referenced and the title is positioned within the HTML channel.
For each product, its name, a product image, and a description are determined and displayed.
As the information is taken from {sf} without substitutions, HTML tags are not required.
