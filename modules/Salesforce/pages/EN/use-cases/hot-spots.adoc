[[hot_spots]]
=== Hot spots
In addition to the <<grid_container,grid container>>, products can be displayed in the form of hot spots.
Each hot spot corresponds to a <<cat_prod_link,product link>>, which is defined on a single static image parallel to the other hot spots.
When you click, a flyout opens for each hot spot, which includes the name, an image, and a description of the corresponding product.

The static image is selected and the hot spots are defined with the help of the _Shop the look_ section template, which can only be added to the <<hp,homepage>> and <<contentpage,content pages>>.

In addition to the static image, the editor can specify a title made up of maximum 20 characters, which can be positioned on the left, on the right or in the center on the image.
The image can either be selected from the media store or uploaded via drag-and-drop on the btn:[Upload a picture] button in the form.
It can be cropped with the help of the familiar {fs} functionality.

[NOTE]
====
If the section is used within a <<blog_article,blog article>>, the image to be selected cannot be cropped.
This functionality is only available if the section is directly integrated into a page.
====

The editor can create any number of hot spots on the image by selecting an image section and defining a <<cat_prod_link,product link>> for this.
The link expects a link text and a product ID.
Both fields are automatically populated when a product is transferred from the product report.
After the form has been saved, the created hot spots are displayed in the relevant location on the image and the link text corresponds to the displayed product name.

[underline]#*Developer view*# +
The HTML channel initially references the selected image and displays it together with the title.
The hot spots are then determined and positioned using the image sections specified by the editor.
For each hot spot, the associated flyout is also created, which appears when the hot spot is clicked and automatically displays the corresponding product information.

The entire content is assigned to the `set_sectionContent` variable, which is required during generation of the <<hp,homepage>> to populate the corresponding XML file.
For a <<contentpage,content page>>, however, the variable is only output.

As the image is referenced from the media store of the {fs} project and is therefore not affected by substitution of {sf} content, the content does not have to be labeled with HTML tags.

[TIP]
====
As the image map in {fs} does not provide the option to upload and crop an image by default, the two scripts _cc_crop_ and _cc_upload_ have been added to the reference project.
They make both functionalities available to the editor.
