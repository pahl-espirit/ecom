[[slot_configuration]]
=== Slot configurations
Within the supplied reference project _{projectname}_, assets are represented by sections.
Depending on the use case, they each have a slot configuration, which makes it possible to deliver editorial content in a way that is specific to the target group and tailored to the customer.

[underline]#*Editor view*# +
The option to configure a slot is provided to an editor in the reference project in the form of an input component.
It is included in the sections available to the editor and may include an unlimited number of slot configurations.
A slot configuration is also defined as a default value for the input component in all available sections.

[NOTE]
====
The preconfigured slot configuration is activated and selected as the default configuration for the associated slot.
To change this, these properties must be modified manually.
====

[NOTE]
====
Unlike the <<hp,homepage>>, the <<login_page,login page>>, and the <<catlandingpage,category pages>>, the <<contentpage,content page>>, the <<catdetailpage,category detail page>>, and the <<proddetailpage,product detail pages>> only creates a single asset and summarizes all sections added to the page in this.
For this reason, it is not possible to define a slot configuration for each section in these cases.
The corresponding input component is therefore hidden for all sections of a content page, a category detail page, or a product detail page.
====

The slot configuration can be (de)activated by the editor and selected as the default configuration for the associated slot.
In addition, it makes it possible to define the schedule parameters known from {sf}.
By adding several sections of the same type (e.g. several sliders) but that have different slot configurations, it is possible to implement different types of content.

[IMPORTANT]
====
One of the schedule parameters to be defined is the `Schedule Type`, for which the `Default` value, among others, can be selected.
In this case, a `Rank` must also be entered, as otherwise errors will occur on the {sf} side.
Without this information, it is not possible to release the associated page.
====

[underline]#*Developer view*# +
An individual slot configuration is represented by the _SFCC Slot Configuration_ link template, which is used within the following sections of the _Slot Configuration_ input component:

* Banner Image
* Slider
* Grid container
* Shop the look
* Text
* Video
* Product Tiles
* Social Media Share
* Social Media Embedding

Within the HTML channel of the link template, the XML expected by {ccloud} is created in line with the configuration defined by the editor and written in the collector provided.
The XML is transferred to {ccloud} using a deployment.

// ************************************ Varianten ************************************
[[variants]]
==== Variants
Slot configurations enable the realisation of different content variants and thus the delivery of target group-specific and customer-specific editorial content.
In order to generate these content variants:

. either multiple slot configurations for a section
. or several sections of the same type (e.g. several sliders) with different slot configurations in a content area

must be created.

Since in the second case all variants would be displayed in the <<uc_preview,preview>> by default, 
the reference project has a variant selection for the <<hp,homepage>>, the <<login_page,login page>> and for <<catlandingpage,category landing pages>> (see figure <<img_variants>>).
As soon as a content area contains more than one section, the variant selection is visible and only the section selected in it is displayed in the preview.

[NOTE]
====
If a section has multiple slot configurations, the variant selection only considers the first one.

Each entry of the variant selection shows the title of the corresponding slot configuration and the parameters defined for it, whereby the default option is visualized in the form of a house icon and the rank as a double arrow.
If the title of a slot configuration is missing, the variant selection represents the section type instead.
In addition, deactivated slot configurations receive a gray background and a corresponding label. 

In addition to the single entries, the variant selection has the {newvar} button, which is used to create new sections in the corresponding content area.
It has the same function as the Easy Edit button on existing sections.

The variant selection is integrated via so-called wrappers, which are integrated into the page or section templates in the form of the _MPP Body Wrapper_ and _MPP Section Wrapper_ format templates.
Calling the _MPP Section Wrapper_ replaces the output of the variable `set_sectionContent` in sections, to which all editorial contents of a section are assigned in the reference project.
Equivalent to this, the _MPP Body Wrapper_ in page templates replaces the output of the respective content area, which must be passed to the wrapper instead.
