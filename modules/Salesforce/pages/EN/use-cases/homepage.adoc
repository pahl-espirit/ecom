=== Homepage
The homepage corresponds to the start page of the reference project supplied and is therefore displayed when the {wc} is first opened.
Since its structure differs from that of the other content pages, it has its own template.
This is referenced in the project just once.

[underline]#*Editor view*# +
The homepage offers the editor three options for entering content:

. The header of the page displays a banner in which either a <<banner_image,static image>> or a <<slider,slider>> can be integrated.
. In the main area of the page:
** Up to five products can be displayed in the form of a <<grid_container,grid container>>, which provides seven different options for arranging the products.
** Any number of products can be linked in the form of <<hot_spots,hot spots>> on a static image.

The sections required for entering content are covered in more detail in the corresponding sub-chapters.

[underline]#*Developer view*# +
The homepage template primarily defines how the page is displayed in the <<uc_preview,{fs} preview>>, whereas assets are predominantly generated in the integrated sections.
However, certain requirements for generation are managed in the form as well as in the HTML channel.
The developer view must therefore take both aspects into account.

*Preview* +
{ccloud} supports a range of page types.
In order to display editorial content in the <<uc_preview,{fs} preview>> or in {wc}, {fs} must generate the correct storefront URL to query the corresponding page in {ccloud}.

The page type to be used for the {fs} preview is defined in the `Preview Page Type` form field.
As `Home` is the only parameter provided for the homepage, it is selected as a default value and the input component is hidden.

To determine the desired storefront URL, it must also be ensured that the language codes used in {fs} and in {ccloud} match.
This task is performed by the _language_mapping_ format template, which is integrated in the HTML channel.
If the language codes do not match, {fs} is unable to determine the corresponding page for the preview.

The sections maintained for the homepage are output within unique HTML comments.
These always consist of a start and an end expression and denote the individual content areas.
Based on the comments, {fs} substitutes the slots in the preview with editorial content.

If a content area has no sections, {fs} displays a gray-shaded area in the preview instead (see figure <<empty_slot_hp>>).
This shows the name of the content area and has a button that allows new sections to be generated in {wc}.
The display of the gray area controls the _empty_content_slot_ format template, while the function of the button is implemented in the _cc_createsectionwe_api_ format template.
It contains JavaScript, which may be integrated in the page only once.

Should further substitutions be required in addition to the exchange of slots, specific regular expressions can be defined.
These have their own syntax and are summarized in the _Preview Generation_ format template.
It controls the generation of the <<uc_preview,preview>> and is referenced in all page templates of the reference project.

*Generation* +
The assets created during the generation are filed in a folder structure in {sf}.
A corresponding folder is therefore defined for each page template in the reference project.
The homepage form has the hidden `SFCC Parent Folder` field, whose value is assigned to the `set_parent_id` variable.
It is evaluated in the integrated sections.

A further requirement for generating assets is that the corresponding page must be marked as translated in {fs}.
If this is not the case, the generation is canceled.
