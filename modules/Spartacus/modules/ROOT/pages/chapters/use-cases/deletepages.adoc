[[uc_delete_pages]]
=== Page deletion
Within the progress of a project, some pages are only required for a certain time.
After that, they are no longer needed and can be removed from the project.
For this purpose the reference project provides the delete workflow of the _{bwfs}_.

This workflow allows the removal of pages as well as media from the {fs} project.
The deletion can be performed either directly or based on the principle of dual control.
After deleting the corresponding element, the workflow releases the parent structure.
The changes are thus directly transferred to the _Preview_ and the _Online {c}_.

[NOTE]
====
The execution of the delete workflow requires both delete and release rights. 
If the executing person is missing one of these rights, the workflow is not available.
