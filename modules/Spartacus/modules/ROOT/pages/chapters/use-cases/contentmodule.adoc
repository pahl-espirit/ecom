[[uc_contentmodule]]
=== Development of a new content module
Within the overall system created with the _{modulname}_ integration, the {sp} Storefront delivers the editorial content.
However, the creation and maintenance of this content shifts from the {ccloud} to {fs}.
For this reason, the provided reference project _{refproject}_ contains the following section templates:

* `teaser`
* `carousel`
* `multi_slot_container`
* `location_overview`

Each of these section templates requires an Angular UI component on the {sp} side.
The UI components receive the contents to be displayed and define their output in the shop.

In addition to the creation of a further section template in the {fs} project,
the development of a new content module therefore always includes the implementation of an associated Angular UI component in the frontend.
In detail, the following steps are required, which will be explained in more detail in the course of the chapter:

* Creation of a section template including maintenance of contents
* Import and configuration of the DataVisualizer
* Creation of a converter
* Implementation of the Angular UI component
* Extension of the Storefront

[[create_section]]
Creation of a section template::
The development of a new content module first requires the creation of a new section template within the {jc}.
The template must then be integrated into a page and filled with content in all available languages.
By saving these contents, they are automatically transferred to the _Preview {c}_ and are thus available in the preview.
+ 
[NOTE]
====
In the steps below, the reference name of the new section template has to be specified at various positions.
These positions are all marked by the placeholder `<SECTION_REF_NAME>`.
The placeholder must be replaced by the reference name in all cases.

The same applies to an input component contained in the section, which is named `st_input_component` in the following steps.
====

// *********************** DataVisualizer *********************** //
Import and configuration of the DataVisualizer::
The `fs-spartacus-view-components` library contains, among other things, the `DataVisualizer`, which enables an unprocessed output of the JSON structure stored in the _{c}_ in the {wc}.
Therefore the DataVisualizer requires an import into the main module of the {sp} application (`app.module.ts`)
as well as the configuration as a display component for the previously created section template.
In addition, the import of the ConfigModule is necessary to provide all features.
+
[source, JavaScript]
.Import of the ConfigModul
----
import { ConfigModule } from '@spartacus/core';
----
+
The following code snippet shows the necessary adjustments in the main module.
The placeholder `<SECTION_REF_NAME>` must be replaced by the *reference name* of the <<create_section,section template>> created in the first step.
+
[source,JavaScript]
.Import and configuration of the DataVisualizer
----
import { ConfigModule } from '@spartacus/core';
import { DataVisualizerComponent } from 'fs-spartacus-view-components';

[...]

@NgModule({
   imports: [
      ConfigModule.withConfig({
         cmsComponents: {<SECTION_REF_NAME>: {component: DataVisualizerComponent}}
      })
   ]
})
export class AppModule { }
----
+
After the integration of the `DataVisualizer`, the page containing the new section shows its associated _{c}_ information in the preview of the {wc}.
With the button {copytocb} the displayed data can also be copied to the clipboard.
They are required for the subsequent creation of the <<create_converter,converter>>.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The parameters `uid` and `typeCode` contained in the displayed data are assumed by the Storefront.
They must therefore be included in the return value of the <<create_converter,converter>> to be created subsequently.
====
+
.Data Visualizer

+
*Example* +
In the case of a section, for example, which only contains a `CMS_INPUT_TEXT` input component for a headline (`st_headline`), the output of the `DataVisualizer` corresponds to the following code snippet:
+
[[caas_document]]
[source,JSON]
.Output of the DataVisualizer
----
{  "uid": "headline",
   "typeCode": "headline",
   "otherProperties": {
      "formData": {
         "st_headline": {
            "fsType": "CMS_INPUT_TEXT",
            "name": "st_headline",
            "value": "Only this week: 20% discount"
         }
      },
      "previewId": "b547b345-6077-4574-97b1-308ebcc2e58d.en_GB"
   }
}
----

// *********************** Converter *********************** //
[[create_converter]]
Creation of a converter::
The data stored in the _{c}_ for the new section is very complex and also contains information that is not needed for the output in the shop.
For this reason, it is recommended to add an additional transformation step before transferring the data to the Angular UI component.
The transformation of the information into a format that is optimal for the component is performed by a converter.
This must contain the following code and is to be be saved under the name `<SECTION_REF_NAME>.component.converter.ts` at any position in the {sp} project.
Thereby the placeholder `<SECTION_REF_NAME>` corresponds to the reference name of the previously created <<create_section,section template>>.
+
[source,JavaScript]
.Converter
----
import { Injectable, InjectionToken } from '@angular/core';
import { Converter, CmsComponent } from '@spartacus/core';

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }) <1>
export class NewSectionComponentConverter implements Converter<CmsComponent, CmsComponent> { <2>
   public convert(source: CmsComponent): CmsComponent { <3>
      return {
         uid: source.uid,
         typeCode: source.typeCode,
         previewId: source.otherProperties.previewId,
         value: source.otherProperties.formData.st_input_component.value <4>
      } as CmsComponent;
   }
}

export const NewSectionConverterToken = new InjectionToken<Converter<CmsComponent,CmsComponent>>('NewSectionConverter'); <5>
----
<1> The Injectable annotation creates a new Angular service.
   This allows the later <<storefront_extension,injection>> of the new converter into the bridge.
<2> The new class `NewSectionComponentConverter` implements the converter interface provided by {sp}, which expects the method `convert`.
   Each time the section for which the converter is registered is processed, this method is called automatically.
<3> Using the `source` parameter, the `convert` method gets all the information available for the section from the _{c}_.
   The return value of the method allows the filtering of this data and defines which parameters are transferred to the Angular UI component. +
   The parameters `uid` and `typeCode` are assumed by the Storefront and are therefore mandatory.
<4> The structure of the associated values is derived from the <<caas_document,_{c}_ document>> and must be adjusted accordingly, especially for the form data to be passed.
   The displayed line refers to a simple `CMS_INPUT_TEXT` input component.
<5> The `NewSectionConverterToken` created here enables the later <<storefront_extension,registration>> of the `NewSectionComponentConverter` in the main module of the {sp} application (`app.module.ts`).

// *********************** UI-Komponente *********************** //
[[create_ui_component]]
Implementation of the Angular UI component::
The data format defined with the help of the <<create_converter,converter>> enables the {angular}[implementation of the Angular UI component],
which must be saved under the name `<SECTION_REF_NAME>.component.ts` at any position in the {sp} project.
+
The following code snippet shows an example of the content of the component:
+
[source,JavaScript]
.Angular UI component
----
import { CmsComponent } from '@spartacus/core';
import { CmsComponentData } from '@spartacus/storefront';
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({ <1>
   template: <2>
      `<ng-container *ngIf="(componentData?.data$) | async as convertedData">
         <h1 [attr.data-preview-id]="convertedData.previewId">{{convertedData.value}}</h1> <3>
      </ng-container>`,
})

export class NewSectionComponent { <4>
   constructor(public componentData: CmsComponentData<CmsComponent>) { }
}
----
<1> The new Angular UI component is created using the Component annotation.
   The annotation enables the later <<storefront_extension,injection>> of the component into the bridge.
<2> The `template` property defines the HTML output of the transferred data within the shop, which has to be adapted to the component to be created on a project-specific basis.
   The output is done via a container element (`ng-container`), which is only displayed in the case of existing data.
   If data exists, it is transferred asynchronously to the content module using the variable `convertedData`.
<3> In this example, the component only outputs a headline.
   Therefore it uses the `value` parameter defined in the <<create_converter,converter>>, which contains the corresponding form data of the initially created <<create_section,section>>.
   It also includes the attribute `data-preview-id`, which contains the `previewId` passed by the converter as a value and allows editing of the headline in the {wc}.
<4> At this point, the new Angular UI component is created.
   It receives the data returned by the <<create_converter,converter>> as constructor parameters.

// *********************** Erweiterung der Storefront *********************** //
[[storefront_extension]]
Extension of the Storefront::
The output of the <<create_section,section>> created in the first step assumes the integration of the implemented <<create_ui_component,Angular UI component>>
and the registration of the new <<create_converter,converter>> in the Storefront.
This requires the following extension of the main module of the {sp} application (`app.module.ts`):
+
[source,JavaScript]
.Extension of the main module
----
import { NewSectionComponent } from './<SECTION_REF_NAME>.component';
import { NewSectionConverterToken, NewSectionComponentConverter } from './<SECTION_REF_NAME>.component.converter';
import { FsComponentConverter } from 'fs-spartacus-common';

@NgModule({
   declarations: [NewSectionComponent], <1>
   imports: [
      ConfigModule.withConfig({
         cmsComponents: {<SECTION_REF_NAME>: { component: NewSectionComponent }} <2>
      })
   ],
   providers: [
      {  provide: NewSectionConverterToken, <3>
         useClass: NewSectionComponentConverter,
         multi: true
      },
      {  provide: FsComponentConverter, <4>
         useValue: {
            <SECTION_REF_NAME>: NewSectionConverterToken
         },
         multi: true <5>
      }
   ],
   entryComponents: [NewSectionComponent] <6>
})
export class AppModule { }
----
<1> Within the main module a declaration of the new component is first made to include it in the {sp} project.
<2> The `imports' attribute links the <<create_section,section template>> created in the first step to the component, instructing {sp} to always use this link when processing the section.
   The placeholder `<SECTION_REF_NAME>` must be replaced with the reference name of the new section template.
<3> The converter is registered in two steps using the `providers` attribute: +
   The first `provide` entry declares the converter as an Angular service in the Storefront.
   It causes the Storefront to automatically create an instance of the converter at runtime each time the `NewSectionConverterToken` is used. +
   For a registration of further converters belonging to other sections, this entry has to be duplicated and adjusted accordingly.
<4> The second `provide` entry introduces the converter to the bridge
   by using the `useValue` parameter to create a link between the newly created <<create_section,section>> and the token of the <<create_converter,converter>>.
   The bridge therefore accesses the token each time the section is processed, which in turn triggers the creation of a new instance of the converter.
   Also in this case, the placeholder `<SECTION_REF_NAME>` must be replaced by the reference name of the new section template. +
   The values of the `useValue` parameter are unlimited in their number and correspond to a key/value pair in each case.
   If further converters belonging to other sections should be introduced to the bridge, the corresponding key/value pairs can be added separated by commas: +
   Example: `useValue: { headline: HeadlineConverterToken, carousel: CarouselConverterToken }` +
<5> In both cases, the `multi` parameter prevents previous declarations from being overwritten at runtime.
<6> The entry `entryComponents` informs the Offline Template Compiler (OTC) of Angular that the component can be generated at runtime.
