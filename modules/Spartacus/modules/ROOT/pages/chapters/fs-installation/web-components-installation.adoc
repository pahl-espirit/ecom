=== Adding the web components
For the {wc}, a web component is needed, which is already added to the reference project.
By default it is installed globally in the `*{manager}*` in the area `*menu:Server Properties[Web applications]*`.
In this case, all installation or configuration steps required for the web component have already been performed by the {creator}.

Alternatively, you may install the web component in the `*Project properties*`.
*Only in this case* it still needs to be installed on an active web server.
Therefore, open the `*{manager}*` and select `*menu:Project properties[Web components]*`.

Within the main panel several tabs are visible, each with a list of the existing web components.
This list contains the following entries for the `*{wc}*`:

* `BasicWorkflows_ContentCreator_Library` (only required when using the _{bwfs}_)
* `CXT {wc} Extension: WebApp for {wc}`
* `{modulname} for SAP {ccloud} Web App`
* `{fs} ThirdPartyPreview WebApp`

In the tab, select a web server via the selection box and start the installation by clicking the btn:[Install] button.
After successful installation, a dialog opens, in which the activation of the web server is to be confirmed.

For detailed information about adding web components, see the _{linkfsadocen}_.
