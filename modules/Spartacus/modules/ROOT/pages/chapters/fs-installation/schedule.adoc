=== Deployment schedules
With _{ccon}_ the publication of editorial content as well as updating the _Online {c}_ takes place with each release.
An additional deployment process is not necessary in this case. 

However, during the progress of the project, situations may arise that require a deployment.
Therefore, the _{ccon}_ module provides two schedules that are automatically added to the project.
They do not require any project-specific customization. 

// A detailed explanation of the schedules is contained in the _{ccondocen}_.
