// Definition der externen Vorschau-URL
[[fs_previewurl]]
=== Definition of the external preview URL
By using the _{ocm}_, the {wc} displays external content from the {ccloud} to which the _{ocm}_ needs access.
The preview URL of the Storefront must therefore be specified in the {wc} properties.
Since the specification is always project-specific, there is no default configuration for it within the reference project.

Open the `*menu:Project properties[{wc}]*` area within the `*{manager}*` and enter the URL of the Storefront in the `External preview URL` field.
