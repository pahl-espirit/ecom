[[rp_pages]]
=== Pages
In contrast to the delivery of content, its creation and maintenance shifts from the {ccloud} to {fs}.
Therefore {fs} provides the {wc}.
In it, <<concept_pagestypes,Shop and {fsdp}s>> can be displayed and enriched with editorial content using the {tppdocen}[_{ocm}_].

Editorial content in {fs} is always created and edited on the basis of a page reference.
It and the page on which it is based are automatically generated in the background in the provided reference project as soon as a new page is created in the {wc}.
The script `page_type_mapping` determines the corresponding {fs} page template which must be included in the project.

The reference project provides the following page templates for content, product, and category pages that correspond to the {sdp}s:

* `cartpagetemplate`
* `contentpage1`
* `landingpage2`
* `searchresultslistpage`
* `storefinderpage`
* `product_detail_page`
* `category_page`

The page templates for the {sdp}s map the respective {ccloud} page templates and differ only in the number of their content areas.
Each of these content areas allows the integration of different sections, which are used to create and persist the editorial content.
The mapping between the {ccloud} templates and the {fs} page templates for the {sdp}s is done in the <<install_pset,project settings>> as described in the installation chapter.
Since {fsdp}s have no associated page in the {ccloud}, no mapping is required for them.

For the Shop as well as for the {fsdp}s it must be ensured that the content areas of the {fs} templates match the <<sp_installation_config_pages, slots>> configured in the bridge:
For each defined slot, the page template must have a content area with *the same* name.
Otherwise, the editorial content will be ignored by the Storefront and not be output in the live state.

[NOTE]
====
The mapping between the configured slots and the content areas of the {fs} page templates is not case-sensitive.
The names `Section1` and `section1` are therefore considered identical and are successfully mapped to each other.

[[rp_pages_inputcomponents]]
In addition, all page templates must have the input components `pt_seoUrl` and `pt_cc_identifier`.
The language-dependent text input component `pt_seoUrl` enables the definition of an SEO url and must therefore be editable.
In contrast, the language-independent text input component `pt_cc_identifier` is a hidden component.
It is filled automatically and ensures the accessibility of the page in the {wc}.

The following code snippet shows the definition of the two input components:
