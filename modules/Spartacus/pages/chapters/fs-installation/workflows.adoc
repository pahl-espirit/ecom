=== Workflows
Content is released and deleted by editors within the supplied reference project _{refproject}_ via the _{bwfs}_.
They are already added to the project and can be used as an alternative to project-specific workflows.

[underline]#*Installation of the {bwfs} module*#

Before using the workflows, the _{bwfs}_ module must first be installed on the {fs} server and the web component must be activated.
The necessary steps are the same as the installation of the other modules and activation of the corresponding <<fs_installation_wcomp,web component>>.
The web component of the _{bwfs}_ is also required in the `*{wc}*` tab.

The use of _{bwfs}_ in {wc} also requires the selection of the provided `{bwfs} Status Provider` in the `*menu:Project properties[{wc}]*` area within the `*{manager}*`.
This setting has already been made in the reference project _{refproject}_.

[underline]#*Templates*#

The _{bwfs}_ need different templates.
These usually have to be imported into the {fs} project via the context menu.
However, they are already included in the reference project and an import of the templates is therefore not necessary.

[underline]#*Permission assignment*#

In the final step, the release workflow must be allowed in each store to run on {fs} elements.
To do this, you can open the permission assignment on the root nodes of the stores via the context menu entry `*menu:Extras[Change Permissions]*`.
This step has already been performed in the reference project and is therefore omitted.

The rights set on the stores' root nodes to execute the workflows refer to the `Everyone` group.
If this is not desired, the rights must be adjusted manually.

[NOTE]
====
More information about the installation, configuration and functionality of the workflows can be found in the _{bwfdocen}_.
