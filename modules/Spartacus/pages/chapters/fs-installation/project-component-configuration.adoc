=== Configuration of the project component
A project-specific configuration is required in order to use the _{modulname}_ module.
It is set up using the project component, which is already added to the reference project supplied.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To use the _{modulname}_ module, the _{ccon}_ module must also be configured.
The necessary steps are described in the _{ccondocen}_.
====

[NOTE]
====
The reference project also includes the project component of the _{cxt}_.
This contains a predefined configuration, the modification of which can lead to a change in the behavior of the {wc}.
An adjustment of the configuration is therefore only to be made after prior consultation with the {techsupport}.
====

To perform configuration, open the `*{manager}*` and select `*menu:Project properties[Project components]*`.

[[projectComponents]]
.Project properties - Project components
image::images/projectcomponents.png[Project properties - Project components]

A list of all existing project components is displayed in the main panel.
Select the entry `{modulname} for SAP {ccloud} Project Configuration` and open the corresponding configuration dialog via btn:[Configure].

The dialog is organized in five tabs, of which currently only the fields of the tabs `*General*`, `*Product DAP*` and `*Category DAP*` are to be considered.
The following subchapters explain them in detail.
The tabs `*Preview*` and `*Content*` currently do not have any functionality.

// Der Dialog gliedert sich in fünf Tabs, die in den nachfolgenden Unterkapiteln einzeln erläutert werden.


// ********************************************* Allgemein *********************************************
[[fs_installation_pcomp_general]]
==== General
The configuration dialog of the project component first contains the tab `*General*`.
The information to be defined in it must be known to the {server} for a connection to the {ccloud}.

.Project component - General
image::images/config-general.png[]

URI::
Within the tab `*General*` the URI of the {ccloud} instance has to be entered first.
It enables the {server} to establish a connection to the {ccloud}.

Connection timeout/Connection retries::
Using the two fields `Connection timeout` and `Connection retries` the time span (in seconds) and the number of attempts can be defined, 
which the {server} uses to establish a connection to the {ccloud}.

[NOTE]
====
The {server} requires <<cc_installation_oauth,OAuth authentication>> to retrieve information from the {ccloud}.
The required authentication data must be entered in the following fields of the `*General*` tab.
The other tabs enable the overwriting of this information and therefore have the same fields.
The overwriting is done by activating the checkbox `Override general OAuth settings` in one of the other tabs.
====

[[pcomp_oauth]]
Auth Server URI::
To connect to the {ccloud}, the {server} requires the specification of the default endpoint for OAuth authentication.
The URI of this endpoint must be entered relatively to the URI of the {ccloud} instance.

Username/Password::
The access data with which the authentication is carried out must be entered in the fields `Username` and `Password`.
Usually this is the data of a technical {ccloud} account.

OAuth Client ID::
This field is used to enter the default client ID used for authentication.
It is created during the configuration of the <<cc_installation_oauth,OAuth Client>> and defines the access rights of the technical account.

OAuth Client Secret::
In addition to the `Client ID`, the specification of the associated `Client Secret` is expected at this point.

OAuth Grant Type::
In addition to the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, OAuth authentication requires a `Grant Type`.
Therefore the combo box offers two options: `password` and `client credentials`.

Test OAuth settings::
By clicking on this button the connection to the {ccloud} can be tested.
If overriding the OAuth authentication was activated in one of the other tabs, the settings stored in it will be taken into account.

// ********************************************* Produkt DAP *********************************************
[[fs_installation_pcomp_product_dap]]
==== Product DAP
In addition to the tab <<fs_installation_pcomp_general,`*General*`>>, the configuration dialog of the project component has the tabs `*Product DAP*` and <<fs_installation_pcomp_category_dap,`*Category DAP*`>>.
They are used to configure the reports in the {wc}, which require various information.

.Project component - Product DAP
image::images/config-product-dap.png[]

Collection::
The product report in the {wc} lists the products originating from the {ccloud} and enables editors to use these products.
The products can be queried via a REST endpoint, which must be known by the {wc}.
It therefore has to be specified in this field.

PDP URL::
The relative URL of a product detail page must be entered in this field.
As a placeholder for the product code the expression `\{code}` can be used.
The default value is `p/\{code}`.

Header/Extract/Icon/Thumbnail::
By default, https://docs.e-spirit.com/odfs/template-develo/snippets/index.html[search results in the product report] show the product name in the header, the catalogue ID in the extract, and a thumbnail.
The fields `Header`, `Extract`, `Icon`, and `Thumbnail` allow the configuration of this information.
For this purpose the following placeholders are available in addition to simple text entries:

* `$\{catalogId}`
* `$\{catalogVersion}`
* `$\{code}`
* `$\{description}`
* `$\{name}`
* `$\{thumbnailMediaUrl}`

{blank}::
The entries in the fields replace the standard information in the search results of the product report.
Textual entries are adopted unchanged.
If the fields remain empty, the search results display the standard information.

Override general OAuth settings::
The fields for OAuth authentication enable the overwriting of the entries in the tab `*General*`.
The overwriting is done by activating the checkbox `Override general OAuth settings`.
Otherwise, the entries from the `*General*` tab will be used for authentication.


// ********************************************* Kategorie DAP *********************************************
[[fs_installation_pcomp_category_dap]]
==== Category DAP
The tab `*Category DAP*` is equivalent to the tab <<fs_installation_pcomp_product_dap,`*Product DAP*`>> and is used to configure the category report in the {wc}.

.Project component - Category DAP
image::images/config-category-dap.png[]

Catalog::
The category report in the {wc} contains the categories from the {ccloud} and makes them available to the editors.
For this purpose, the corresponding catalog ID must be entered here.

Catalog Version::
The categories provided in the {wc} originate from a product catalog.
Therefore, in addition to the catalog ID, the version of the product catalog from which the categories are obtained must also be specified.

CDP URL::
The relative URL of a category detail page must be entered in this field.
As a placeholder for the category code the expression `\{code}` can be used.
The default value is `c/\{code}`.

Override general OAuth settings::
The fields for OAuth authentication enable the overwriting of the entries in the tab `*General*`.
The overwriting is done by activating the checkbox `Override general OAuth settings`.
Otherwise, the entries from the `*General*` tab will be used for authentication.
