==== {ccloud} Page Template
In {fs}, the editorial content is created and edited in {wc}.
With the help of the _{ocm}_, the staged storefront of the {ccloud} is embedded in it.
The Staged Storefront in turn accesses the _Preview {c}_ and determines the current {fs} contents from it.
This also applies to the online storefront and the _Online {c}_.

This link requires modifications to the page template of the {ccloud} content page; these modifications are explained in this chapter.
The modifications are contained in the `landingLayout2Page.jsp` page, which is part of the delivery, and can be reproduced in this page.

The following code extract shows the querying of a _{c}_ item that is saved in the variable `caasItem`.
The first step of this process is to determine the _{c}_ collection in which the data is stored:
The {fs} content pages from the reference project are always stored in the _contentpages_ collection, while other content is stored in the standard collection _content_.

[source,html]
.Example - Querying of the {c} item
----
<%@ taglib prefix="caas" uri="/WEB-INF/tld/addons/fscontentconnect/caas.tld" %>

<c:choose>
   <c:when test="${cmsPage.typeCode == 'ContentPage'}">
      <c:set var="caasCollection" value="contentpages"/>
   </c:when>
   <c:otherwise>
      <c:set var="caasCollection" value="content"/>
   </c:otherwise>
</c:choose>

<caas:request itemId="${cmsPage.uid}" collection="${caasCollection}" var="caasItem" />
----

To edit editorial content, {wc} displays the familiar EasyEdit buttons, which appear together with a frame while hovering.
Via Omnichannel Manager, {wc} can display external content.
However, _{ocm}_ requires information from {ccloud} to highlight this content.
This information is read from a data object, which is populated via the corresponding page template in {ccloud}.

The following code extract shows an example of how this type of data object may be populated; the page type, preview ID, and page ID are transferred to this object.
The preview ID matches the ID of the previously determined _{c}_ item.
If it was not possible to query a _{c}_ item, the preview ID in the data object remains empty.

[source,html]
.Example - Population of a data object
----

[... Determine the CaaS item (see above) ...]

<c:set var="pagePreviewId" value="${not empty caasItem and not empty caasItem['previewId'] ? caasItem['previewId'] : ''}"/>

<caas:whenFirstSpiritPreview>
   <script type="text/javascript">
      const PAGE_PREVIEW_DATA = {
         pageType: '${cmsPage.typeCode}',
         pagePreviewId: '${pagePreviewId}',
         pageId: '${cmsPage.uid}',
         pageTemplate: '${cmsPage.masterTemplate.uid}'
      };
   </script>
</caas:whenFirstSpiritPreview>

[NOTE]
====
For product detail pages, the product code must be defined as the page ID instead of the UID:

[source,html]
.Example - Defining the product code
----
const PAGE_PREVIEW_DATA = {
   [...]
   pageId: '${productCode}',
   [...]
};
----
====

In addition to determining the _{c}_ item and populating the data object, the output must also be defined.
As part of this process, a check is needed whether the previously determined _{c}_ item includes content for the relevant content area.
If this is not the case, fallback content can be defined.

The following code extract shows the definition of the output for the content area `stage_body`:

[source,html]
.Example - Definition of output
----
<%@ taglib prefix="caas" uri="/WEB-INF/tld/addons/fscontentconnect/caas.tld" %>

[... Determine the CaaS item and set the PAGE_PREVIEW_DATA object (see above) ...]

<c:choose>
   <c:when test="${not empty caasItem and not empty caasItem['slots']['stage_body']}">
      <div data-slot-name="stage_body">
         ${caasItem['slots']['stage_body']}
      </div>
   </c:when>
   <c:otherwise>
      <div data-slot-name="stage_body" data-fs-content-editing>
         <cms:pageSlot position="Section1" var="feature">
            <cms:component component="${feature}"/>
         </cms:pageSlot>
      </div>
   </c:otherwise>
</c:choose>
----

Whether the outcome is positive or the fallback is applied, a Dom element must be defined to mark the {fs} content area.
This element allows external content to be visually highlighted and maintained in {wc}.
The name of the content area must be transferred to the Dom element via the `data-slot-name` attribute.
In the event of a fallback, the Dom element also requires the attribute `data-fs-content-editing`.
This attribute controls the display of a plus button in {wc}, which shows the label `override content` or `add content` when hovering.

override content::
If the fallback is applied and existing content from {ccloud} is displayed, the button is displayed with the `override content` label while hovering.
This means that there is not yet any content in {fs} for the content area.
For this reason, the existing content can only be overwritten and not edited.
The previously described code extract shows this option.

add content::
If the fallback is applied and the Dom element does not contain any content, the button is displayed with the `add content` label while hovering.
This situation can arise when there is no content on an empty page for the area in {ccloud}, or if no content has been defined for the Dom element.
Within the `landingLayout2Page.jsp` page, which is included in the delivery, this option is used for the output of the `main_body` content area:
