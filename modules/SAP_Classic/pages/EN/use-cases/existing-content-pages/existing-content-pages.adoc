=== Maintenance of existing {ccloud} content pages
The _{modulname}_ module enables editors to maintain content pages that already exist in {ccloud} in {fs}.
For this purpose, the content pages are displayed in {wc} via _{ocm}_, enabling them to be seamlessly integrated into the familiar {fs} editorial process.

As well as <<javascript,integrating _{ocm}_>>, which is an installation step, the presentation channel of the page and section templates must be completed in order to maintain content pages in {fs}.
In addition, the relevant page template must also be modified in {ccloud}.
