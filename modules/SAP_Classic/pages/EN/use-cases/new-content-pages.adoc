=== Maintaining content on new {ccloud} content pages

// To Do: SAPCC-118

The maintenance of content on new {ccloud} content pages is subject to the same requirements as the maintenance of <<edit-existing-content-pages,existing {ccloud} content pages>>.

However, the creation of new pages must be configured in the <<configContent,project component>>.
Once this configuration is complete, the familiar {wc} functions can be used to create new pages.

[NOTE]
====
The `label` attribute of new {ccloud} content pages is set by the _{modulname}_ module and by default starts with a slash (`/`).
