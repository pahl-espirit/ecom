=== Maintaining content on product detail pages
To maintain content on product detail pages, in addition to the relevant <<addon,storefront expansions>>, the modifications to the presentation channel of the templates - as described in chapter <<edit-existing-content-pages>> - must also have been implemented.

Once these requirements are met, product detail pages can be maintained in the same way as content pages.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Product detail and content pages must be stored in different structure and content folders in {fs} and in different collections in _{c}_.
