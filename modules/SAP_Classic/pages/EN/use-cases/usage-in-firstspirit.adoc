=== Inclusion of a product or category
A product or category can be dragged from the report and dropped into an `FS_INDEX` input component in the editing dialog.
Alternatively, the component has an btn:[Add] button which opens a selection dialog.
This dialog lists all the available products and categories.

The selection is saved using the button of the same name.

=== Calling up a content page or product/category detail page
Content pages as well as product and category detail pages can be accessed via the shop navigation and via the product, category or search report.
In the report, these pages are called up by clicking on one of them.
Thereby detail pages that are not yet available in the shops main navigation can also be called up.

To determine the URL of product and category detail pages, the reports use the URLs from the fields <<pdp_url,`PDP URL`>> and <<cdp_url,`CDP URL`>> 
that must be specified during the configuration of the project component. +
Content pages can have specific URLs that are optionally specified during the definition of the <<template_mappings,`Template Mappings`>>.
If a content page does not have a specific URL, the general <<contentpage_url,`Contentpage URL`>> is used for it instead.
If one of these fields contains a relative URL, this is converted into an absolute URL based on the URL of the current shop page.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The product report shows all of the products in the configured product catalog.
This means that the detail pages of all products in the catalog must be accessible.
To ensure that this is the case, the <<searchrestrictions,configuration of the FlexibleSearch Restrictions>> must be checked.
