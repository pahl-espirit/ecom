==== Integrating {ocm} into the storefront
In {fs}, the editorial content is created and edited in the {wc}.
With the help of the _{ocm}_, the staged storefront of the {ccloud} is embedded in it.
The Staged Storefront in turn accesses the _Preview {c}_ and determines the current {fs} contents from it.

To enable the content from the storefront to be edited in {wc}, the _{ocm}_ JavaScript must be integrated into {ccloud}.
For this purpose, the Taglib and the <<ocmscript,tag `caas:includeOcmScripts`>> must be integrated into the `javaScript.tag` file.
The delivery includes storefront modifications with _{ocm}_ already integrated, which renders this step unnecessary.
