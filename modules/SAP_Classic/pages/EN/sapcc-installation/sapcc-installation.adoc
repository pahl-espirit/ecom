== {ccloud} - Installation and configuration
{fs} is used to create and maintain editorial data, which is then transferred to and persisted by _{c}_.
To integrate the data into the shop, {ccloud} requires access to _{c}_.
This access is provided by an add-on included in the delivery package which must be installed and configured on the {ccloud} side.
The delivery also includes storefront modifications that already incorporate the add-on.

The following chapters explain all necessary steps for installing and configuring the add-on and the required {ccloud} expansions.
