[[addon-sites]]
==== Connection of multiple sites
The _{modulname}_ module allows editors to create {ccloud} content using {fs} and to integrate it into the shop.
This requires the {ccloud} to be connected to the _{c}_.
The parameters needed for the connection are definable either in the <<addon-config,configuration file>> of the previously installed add-on or for each site.
The _{modulname}_ module thus allows multiple sites to be connected to {fs}.

The configuration of the sites is done in the {ccloud} backoffice.
Under the item `*Administration*` each site has the fields visible in the following figure.

.configuration parameters of a site

The information defined in the fields always refers to the corresponding site only.
If no entry exists for a field, the parameter specified in the <<addon-config,configuration file of the add-on>> represents a fallback value.
Since the data stored in the configuration file applies to all sites, mixed operation can be implemented in this way.
For example, it is possible to store the {key}, the protocol as well as the URL and the port of the _{c}_ centrally in the configuration file, 
while the name of the database to be used is specified separately for each site.
The site-specific parameters always overwrite the data persisted in the configuration file.
