===  Installing the modules
In order to provide the functions of the _{modulname}_ module, the modules _{caas}_ and _{ocm}_ are additionally required, which must also be installed on the {fs} server.
Furthermore, when using the supplied _{refproject}_, the _{bwfs}_ and the _{cxt}_ must also be installed.

[NOTE]
====
The delivery only includes the _{modulname}_ module.
The _{caas}_ and _{ocm}_ modules as well as the _{bwfs}_ and the _{cxt}_ can be obtained from {techsupport}.
====

To install the modules, open the `*{manager}*` and select `*menu:Server properties[Modules]*`.

.Server properties - Module installation

The main panel contains a list of all modules installed on the {fs} server.
After clicking btn:[Install], select the following files one after the other and confirm your selection with btn:[Open]:

* `contentconnect-sap-module-<Versionnumber>.fsm`
* `caas-<Versionnumber>.fsm`
* `fs-tpp-api-<Versionnumber>.fsm`
* `cxt-cc-extension-<Versionsnummer>.fsm` (only required when using the reference project)
* `basicworkflows-fsm-<Versionsnummer>.fsm` (only required when using the _{bwfs}_)

After the successful installation, the folders `{modulname} for SAP {ccloud}`, `{caas}`, `{fs} ThirdPartyPreview`, and optionally the folders `{bwfs}` and `{cxt}` were added to the list.
Each of which must be given `All permissions`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The _{caas}_ module contains a service used to define a standard configuration.
The steps required to do this are described in the _{caasfsmdocen}_.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
After any module installation or update, the {fs} server needs to be restarted.
