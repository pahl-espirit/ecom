=== Adding the web components
The _{modulname}_ integration requires various web components to be added to the project used.
Therefore open the `*menu:Server Properties[Web applications]*` panel in the `*{manager}*`.

Within the main panel several tabs are visible, each with a list of the existing web components.
Choose the `*{wc}*` tab and add the following web components:

* `{bwfs}_ContentCreator_Library` (only required when using the _{bwfs}_)
* `{cxt} Extension: WebApp for {wc}` (only required when using the reference project)
* `{modulname} for SAP {ccloud} Web App`
* `{fs} ThirdPartyPreview WebApp`

Select the web components one after the other using the btn:[Add] button and confirm each selection with btn:[OK].

Finally, select an `Active web server` in the tab using the selection box of the same name and start the installation by clicking the btn:[Install] button.
After successful installation, a dialog opens, in which the activation of the web server is to be confirmed.
