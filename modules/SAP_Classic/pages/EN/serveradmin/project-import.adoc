=== Project import
Included in the delivery is the _{refproject}_, which must be installed on the {fs} server.
To do this, open the import dialog in the `*{manager}*` via the menu item `*menu:Project[Import]*` and click the btn:[Local] button to select the `referenceproject-<VERSIONNUMBER>.tar.gz` file from your local data system.
Then assign a project name and description and confirm the import with btn:[Yes].
After successful installation, the project is added to the list in the main panel.

[NOTE]
====
In addition to the standard groups `Everyone`, `Administrators` and `Developers`, there are three further *external* user groups in the reference project: `Editors`, `ChiefEditors` and `ProjectAdmins`.
The groups have different rights, which are selected according to their tasks and defined for the different stores.
Users outside these groups are not allowed to use the reference project by default.

The usage of external groups requires an LDAP connection.
Otherwise they are not usable and the rights set for them do not apply.
