=== Range of functions
_{modulname}_ allows editors to:

* Create {ccloud} content using {fs} for one or more sites of a {ccloud} instance
* Access to product and category information
* Display shop elements and editorial content in the {fs} preview simultaneously
* Transfer of content to {ccloud}

The corresponding functions are made available when the module is installed and configured in {wc}.

Familiar {fs} tools are used to maintain the content, meaning that editors who are already familiar with {fs} do not require any additional knowledge.
The content is made available to {ccloud} as part of a deployment so that it can be imported.
It integrates the information into the shop.

As far as {ccloud} is concerned, this means there is no difference when it comes to delivering editorial content to the live state.
Even if the {fs} server is shut down because of maintenance work, for example, this has no effect on {ccloud}.
