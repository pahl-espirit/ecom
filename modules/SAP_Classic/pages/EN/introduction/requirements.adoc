[NOTE]
====
The version number of the delivery differs from the version numbers of the individual components of the delivery.
It follows a scheme of two-digit year, month number and the number of the release within the respective month (for example: `20.10.0` for the first release in October 2020)
In contrast, the module, the reference project, and the add-on receive their own version numbers, which are separated from the version number of the delivery.
