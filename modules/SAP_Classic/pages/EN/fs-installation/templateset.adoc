=== Presentation channel
An additional XML channel is required in addition to the presentation channels that already exist for the project.
For empty projects, this channel must be created manually; however, it is already contained within the supplied _{refproject}_.

The presentation channel was created in the `*{manager}*` under `*menu:Project properties[Template sets]*` and is configured as follows:

[[templateset]]
.Presentation channel
image::templateset.png[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
In the selection box of the same name, the conversion rule to be created for _{c}_ must be selected.
The steps required to do this are described in the _{caasfsmdocen}_.
====

The presentation channel is activated and is therefore available in the project.
It is used to define the content to be transferred, which is summarized in messages during the generation operation and transferred to _{c}_.
