=== Release workflow
Within the supplied _{refproject}_, content is released by editors via the release workflow of the _{bwfs}_.
This can be used as an alternative to project-specific workflows.

[underline]*Installing the {bwfs} module*

Before using the release workflow, you must install the _{bwfs}_ module on the {fs} Server and activate the web component.
The steps required to do this are the same as those required for the installation of the other modules and the activation of the associated <<wcomp,web component>>.
By default, these steps are already performed.

In addition, to use _{bwfs}_ in the {wc}, the provided `{bwfs} Status Providers` must be selected in the `*menu:Project properties[{wc}]*` area within the `*{manager}s*`.
This setting has already been applied in the _{refproject}_.

[underline]*Templates*

The _{bwfs}_ require various templates.
Usually, these templates need to be imported via the context menu in the {fs} project used.
However, they are already contained within the reference project and importing the templates is therefore not necessary.

[underline]*Permission assignment*

In the final step, the release workflow must be authorized in the individual stores so that they can be executed on {fs} elements.
To do this, select `*menu:Extras[Change permissions]*` from the context menu of the stores' root nodes to call up the permission assignment.
This step has also already been carried out in the reference project and is therefore omitted.

The permissions for executing the workflow set on the stores' root nodes relate to the Everyone group.
This can only be changed by modifying the permissions manually.

[NOTE]
====
More detailed information on the installation, configuration, and functionality of the workflow can be found in the _{bwfdocen}_.
