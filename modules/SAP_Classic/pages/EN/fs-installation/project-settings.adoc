=== Project settings
There is some essential project-specific information that needs to be entered for the connection between {fs} and {ccloud}.
It is entered using the project settings form and must be specified within the project being used.

Within the supplied reference project, the project settings page with the required configuration already exists.
In this case, there is no need to create the template or the required components.

[NOTE]
====
Changes to the project settings do not take effect straight away, as they are saved in the session of the user.
They require the client to be restarted.

CONTENT PAGE | LANDINGPAGE2 TEMPLATE::
For the maintenance of <<edit-existing-content-pages,existing {ccloud} content pages>> in {fs} each {ccloud} page template must be assigned to a {fs} template.
The {fs} template selected in this field is used to maintain {ccloud} content pages based on the {ccloud} template `LandingPage2Template`.
To support different or further {ccloud} templates the project settings form must be extended by similar fields.
This information enables the scripts `page_type_mapping` and `get_page_type` to correctly map {ccloud} and {fs} content pages.
Therefore changes in the project settings page have to be reflected in these two scripts.

CONTENT PAGE FOLDER::
Within the {fs} project, all content pages are created in the same content folder, which is defined in this field.
The script `page_type_mapping` requires the details of the folder for the maintenance of <<edit-existing-content-pages,existing {ccloud} content pages>>.
