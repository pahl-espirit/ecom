=== Configuring the project component
A project-specific configuration is required in order to use the _{modulname}_ module.
It is set up using the project component, which is already added to the reference project supplied.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To use the _{modulname}_ module, the _{caas}_ and the _{ocm}_ modules must also be configured.
The steps required to do this are described in the _{caasfsmdocen}_ and in the _{tppdocen}_.
====

[NOTE]
====
The reference project also includes the project component of the _{cxt}_.
This contains a predefined configuration, the modification of which can lead to a change in the behavior of the {wc}.
An adjustment of the configuration is therefore only to be made after prior consultation with the {techsupport}.
====

To perform configuration, open the `*{manager}*` and select `*menu:Project properties[Project components]*`.

[[config2]]
.Project component - Product DAP
image::config-product-dap.png[]

Collection::
This field is used to define the end point for product data queries.

[[pdp_url]]
PDP URL::
The URL of a product detail page must be entered in this field.
Both absolute and relative URLs are permitted.
`\{code}` can be used as a placeholder for the product code.
The default value is `p/\{code}`.

Header/Extract/Icon/Thumbnail::
By default, search results in the product report show the product name in the header, the catalogue ID in the extract, and a thumbnail.

* `$\{code}`
* `$\{description}`
* `$\{name}`
* `$\{thumbnailMediaUrl}`

{blank}::
The entries in the fields replace the standard information in the search results of the product report.
Textual entries are adopted unchanged.
If the fields remain empty, the search results display the standard information.

Override general OAuth settings::
The fields for OAuth authentication contained in this tab enable the overwriting of the entries in the tab `*General*`.
The overwriting is done by activating the checkbox `Override general OAuth settings`.
Otherwise, the entries from the `*General*` tab will be used for authentication.

[[configPreview]]
.Project component - Preview

Page Id::
This field indicates the ID of the page of the generated preview ticket.

https://help.sap.com/doc/65f54fc80c71428cb3425c97daf250e5/1808/en-US/previewwebservices/index.html#_previewticket[preview ticket] in the `Preview API` of {ccloud}.
This ticket is requested by {fs} to allow a protected storefront to be previewed in {wc}.
The delivery includes the file `fs-preview-session-initializer.js`, which is used as necessary by the `caas:includeOcmScripts` tag and triggers the generation of a preview ticket by calling up an executable.
If necessary, additional parameters can be transferred during this call to overwrite the settings on the `Preview` tab shown here.
The structure of the parameter object must match the structure of one of the 
https://help.sap.com/doc/65f54fc80c71428cb3425c97daf250e5/1808/en-US/previewwebservices/index.html#_previewticket[preview tickets] in the `Preview API`.

Override general OAuth settings::
The fields for OAuth authentication contained in this tab enable the overwriting of the entries in the tab `*General*`.
The overwriting is done by activating the checkbox `Override general OAuth settings`.
Otherwise, the entries from the `*General*` tab will be used for authentication.

// ************************************ Inhalte ************************************

[[configContent]]
.Project component - Contents
image::config-content.png[]

Site Id::
The ID of the {ccloud} site (e.g. `powertools`) must be entered in this field.

Content Catalog Id::
As with the Site Id, this field is used to enter the ID of the content catalog (e.g. `powertoolsContentCatalog`).

Content Catalog Version::
In this field, the version of the content catalog to be used must be selected (`Staged` or `Online`).

[[template_mappings]]
Template Mappings::
To maintain existing {ccloud} pages in {fs}, a {fs} template must be assigned to each {ccloud} template.
For this purpose, a mapping between the `{ccloud} Template Item IDs` and the corresponding `{fs} Page Template UIDs` must be defined at this point.
+
Since the content pages based on the templates can have different URLs, the `{ccloud} URL Pattern` column enables the creation of a specific preview URL in each case.
The URL can be entered either relative to the storefront or the host (see example below).
Furthermore, it is also possible to use the placeholder `pageUid`.
If the column remains empty, the URL defined in the <<contentpage_url,`Contentpage URL`>> field is used instead for the preview of the corresponding page.
+
*Example* +
The configuration visible in the figure would have the following meaning:
+
[options="header", cols="10,10,10,70" ]
.{ccloud} URL Pattern - Example
|=======
|{fs} template | Entry | resulting URL | Explanation
|content_page 
|/magazin/outdoor
|http(s)://<host>/magazin/outdoor
|If the entry starts with a slash, only the server URL is extended.

|content_page_1
|---
|http(s)://<host>/<storefront-context-root>/preview-content?uid={pageUid} 
|Since no specific URL is defined in this case, the general `Contentpage URL` is used instead.

|content_page_2 
|assortment/{pageUid}
|http(s)://<host>/<storefront-context-root>/assortment/{pageUid}
|This entry has no leading slash.
  It therefore represents a URL relative to the storefront.
  Furthermore, it contains the placeholder `pageUid`.

|content_page_3
|indoor
|http(s)://<host>/<storefront-context-root>/indoor
|This entry also does not contain a leading slash and therefore also leads to an extension of the storefront URL.
|=======


Content Page Attribute Mapping::
The data entered here corresponds to the mapping of the {fs} content page attributes to the {ccloud} content page attributes.
+
The following {fs} input components are supported for entering the {fs} content page attributes: `CMS_INPUT_TEXT`, `CMS_INPUT_TOGGLE`, `CMS_INPUT_RADIOBUTTON`, `CMS_INPUT_CHECKBOX`, `CMS_INPUT_COMBOBOX`, `CMS_INPUT_LIST`, `CMS_INPUT_DATE`, `CMS_INPUT_NUMBER`, `CMS_INPUT_TEXTAREA`.

Override general OAuth settings::
The fields for OAuth authentication contained in this tab enable the overwriting of the entries in the tab `*General*`.
