[[install_previewurl]]
=== Definition of the external preview URL
By using the _{ocm}_, the {wc} displays external content from the storefront of the {ccloud} to which the _{ocm}_ needs access.
The preview URL of the storefront must therefore be specified in the {wc} properties.
This must be extended by the parameter `firstSpiritPreview=1`, which is required for initializing the preview.
Since the specification of the URL is always project-specific, there is no default configuration for it within the reference project.

*Example:* `\https://sap-storefront.e-spirit.com?site=e-spirit&firstSpiritPreview=1`

Open the `*menu:Project properties[{wc}]*` area within the `*{manager}*` and enter the URL of the storefront in the `External preview URL` field.
