[[wcomp]]
=== Adding web components
The {wc} requires a web component that has already been added to the reference project supplied.
By default it is installed globally in the `*{manager}*` in the area `*menu:Server Properties[Web applications]*`.
In this case, all installation or configuration steps required for the web component have already been performed by the {creator}.

Alternatively, you may install the web component in the `*Project properties*`.
*Only in this case* it still needs to be installed on an active web server.
To do this, open the `*{manager}*` and select `*menu:Project properties[Web components]*`.

Inside the main panel, various tab pages are visible.
Each tab page contains a list of the existing web components.
This list contains the following entries for `*{wc}*`:

* `{bwfs}_ContentCreator_Library` (only required when using the _{bwfs}_)
* `{cxt} Extension: WebApp for {wc}` (only required when using the reference project)
* `{modulname} for SAP {ccloud} Web App`
* `{fs} ThirdPartyPreview WebApp`

Select an `Active web server` on the tab page via the selection box of the same name and start the installation by clicking the btn:[Install] button.
After successful installation, a dialog opens, in which the activation of the `Web server` must be confirmed.

Detailed information on how to configure web components is available in the _{linkfsadocen}_.
