[[install_schedule]]
=== Deployment schedule
By default, the release of content does not involve any update to _Online {c}_ or any transfer for data to the {ccloud}.
Instead, it only involves the {fs} release process, which can be mapped, for example, using the <<install_workflow,Release workflow of the _{bwfs}_>>.
The _Online {c}_ update and data transfer to the {ccloud} only takes place when the content is deployed.

The deployment of released editorial content is executed via a _{c}_ schedule.
This executes a _{c}_ generation and transfers the data to _Online {c}_, which then makes it available to {ccloud}.
The schedule can also be used to synchronize the online content catalog in {ccloud}.

[NOTE]
====
The update of the online content catalog may involve various dependencies.
For this reason, a decision as to whether the approval and synchronization processes form part of the import process or not must be made on a project-specific basis.

It is also possible to simply carry out an approval and a <<direct_release,direct publication in the online content catalogue>>.
In this case, the synchronization of the data must be ensured on a project-specific basis.

The supplied reference project contains a schedule that incorporates the following actions:

.Generation schedule actions

The actions `Initialize {c}Generation`, `{c} Generate`, `{c} CleanUp`, and `Finalize {c} Generation` make up the _{c}_ schedule.
The actions described in the following sub-chapters are added to the schedule.
As the <<bulk_update,Bulk Update>> requires access to the <<app_sync,Approval or Sync Definition>>, these actions are described in reverse order.

[NOTE]
====
The _{caasfsmdocen}_ contains further information on the _{c}_ schedule.
